    "Info": "John Christopher \u0026quot;Johnny\u0026quot; Depp II was born on June 9, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Betty Sue Palmer (n\u00E9e Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer. He was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named \u0026#39;The Kids\u0026#39;. When he married Lori A. Depp, he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp\u0026#39;s film debut in the low-budget horror film, \u0416\u0430\u0445 \u043D\u0430 \u0432\u0443\u043B\u0438\u0446\u0456 \u0412\u0026#39;\u044F\u0437\u0456\u0432 (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987). In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in \u0415\u0434\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0420\u0443\u043A\u0438-\u043D\u043E\u0436\u0438\u0446\u0456 (1990). Following the film\u0026#39;s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of \u0415\u0434 \u0412\u0443\u0434 (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film \u0414\u043E\u043D\u043D\u0456 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043A\u043E (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0456 \u043E\u0433\u0438\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u041B\u0430\u0441-\u0412\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0441\u0456 (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film \u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043D\u0430 \u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043E\u043D\u0430\u0432\u0442\u0430 (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in \u0421\u043E\u043D\u043D\u0430 \u043B\u043E\u0449\u0438\u043D\u0430 (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in \u0406\u0437 \u043F\u0435\u043A\u043B\u0430 (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez\u0026#39;s \u0026quot;mariachi\u0026quot; trilogy, \u042F\u043A\u043E\u0441\u044C \u0443 \u041C\u0435\u043A\u0441\u0438\u0446\u0456 (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster \u041F\u0456\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u041A\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0441\u044C\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043C\u043E\u0440\u044F: \u041F\u0440\u043E\u043A\u043B\u044F\u0442\u0442\u044F \u0427\u043E\u0440\u043D\u043E\u0457 \u043F\u0435\u0440\u043B\u0438\u043D\u0438 (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film\u0026#39;s enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, \u0422\u0430\u0454\u043C\u043D\u0435 \u0432\u0456\u043A\u043D\u043E (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based \u0427\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432\u043D\u0430 \u043A\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043D\u0430 (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004).

    "Info": "With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who\nwould have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a\nsmall European village would become one of Hollywood\u0026#39;s biggest stars,\nmarry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd\ninvestments and one day be the Governor of California!?The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \u0026quot;rags to\nriches\u0026quot; tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of\nopportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav\nSchwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a\nkeen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete\nin several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated\nto the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star\nbegan to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather\noddball sport, or even a mis-understood \u0026quot;freak show\u0026quot; by the general\npublic, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers\nBen Weider and\nJoe Weider set about broadening the appeal of\n\u0026quot;pumping iron\u0026quot; and getting the sport respect, and what better poster\nboy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \u0026quot;Austrian\nOak\u0026quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in\n1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding\nwinning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with\nit, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new\ninternational audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide\nswelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire\nflourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe.\nHowever, Schwarzenegger\u0026#39;s horizons were bigger than just the landscape\nof bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \u0026quot;Arnold Strong\u0026quot; in the low\nbudget\n\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043A\u0443\u043B\u0435\u0441 \u0443 \u041D\u044C\u044E-\u0419\u043E\u0440\u043A\u0443 (1970),\nthen director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in\n\u0417\u0430\u043B\u0438\u0448\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044F \u0433\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0434\u043D\u0438\u043C (1976) alongside\nJeff Bridges and\nSally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden\nGlobe Award for \u0026quot;Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\u0026quot;. The\nmesmerizing \u041A\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043B\u0456\u0437\u043E (1977)\ncovering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on\nto become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus\nArnold landed other acting roles in the comedy\n\u041B\u0438\u0445\u043E\u0434\u0456\u0439 (1979) opposite\nKirk Douglas, and he portrayed\nMickey Hargitay in the well- received TV\nmovie\nThe Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a\nlavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him\nroom to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor.\n\u041A\u043E\u043D\u0430\u043D-\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440 (1982)\nwas just that role. Inspired by the\nRobert E. Howard short stories of the\n\u0026quot;Hyborean Age\u0026quot; and directed by gung ho director\nJohn Milius, and with a largely unknown\ncast, save Max von Sydow and\nJames Earl Jones, \u0026quot;Conan\u0026quot; was a smash\nhit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled\n\u041A\u043E\u043D\u0430\u043D-\u0440\u0443\u0439\u043D\u0456\u0432\u043D\u0438\u043A (1984)\nquickly followed. If \u0026quot;Conan\u0026quot; was the kick start to Arnold\u0026#39;s movie\ncareer, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and\naccelerate his star status into overdrive. Director\nJames Cameron had until that time\nonly previously directed one earlier feature film titled\n\u041F\u0456\u0440\u0430\u043D\u044C\u0457 2 (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for\nan actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator -\n\u0422\u0435\u0440\u043C\u0456\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 (1984). Made on a\nrelatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction\nthriller \u0422\u0435\u0440\u043C\u0456\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 (1984) was\nincredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable\nfilm franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \u0026quot;I\u0026#39;ll be back\u0026quot; quickly\nbecame part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in\nvogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold\nreap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals\nwho used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done.\nThe testosterone laden \u041A\u043E\u043C\u043C\u0430\u043D\u0434\u043E (1985),\n\u0411\u0435\u0437 \u043A\u043E\u043C\u043F\u0440\u043E\u043C\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0432 (1986),\n\u0425\u0438\u0436\u0430\u043A (1987),\n\u041B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430, \u0449\u043E \u0431\u0456\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044C (1987) and\n\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043E\u043D\u0430 \u0441\u043F\u0435\u043A\u0430 (1988) were all box office hits\nand Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking\nwinning scripts.

The spectacular\n\u0417\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 (1990) and \u0026quot;feel good\u0026quot;\n\u0414\u0438\u0442\u0441\u0430\u0434\u043A\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043F\u043E\u043B\u0456\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0438\u0439 (1990) were\nboth solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to\nreturn to familiar territory with director\nJames Cameron in\n\u0422\u0435\u0440\u043C\u0456\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 2: \u0421\u0443\u0434\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043D\u044C (1991).\nThe second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget\nhad grown from the initial film\u0026#39;s $6.5 million to an alleged $100\nmillion for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel\nbristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases \u0026amp; stunt\nsequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery.\n\u0422\u0435\u0440\u043C\u0456\u043D\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 2: \u0421\u0443\u0434\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043D\u044C (1991)\nwas arguably the zenith of Arnold\u0026#39;s film career to date and he was\nvoted \u0026quot;International Star of the Decade\u0026quot; by the National Association of\nTheatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film\n\u041E\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043D\u043D\u0456\u0439 \u043A\u0456\u043D\u043E\u0433\u0435\u0440\u043E\u0439 (1993) brought\nArnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but\nconfusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood\naction film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in\ndroves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned\nback to good friend, director\nJames Cameron and the chemistry\nwas definitely still there as the \u0026quot;James Bond\u0026quot; style spy thriller\n\u041F\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043D\u044F (1994) co-starring\nJamie Lee Curtis and\nTom Arnold was the surprise hit of\n1994!

The family surname\nwas originally \u0026quot;Carr\u00E9\u0026quot;, and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish\nancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child,\nhe performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed\nhis r\u00E9sum\u00E9 to\nThe Carol Burnett Show (1967)\nat age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the\nend of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates\n(provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey\u0026#39;s early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when\nthe family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to\nScarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial\njobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after\nschool let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered).\nWhen they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a\nVolkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and\nsiblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful)\nprofessional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk\u0026#39;s, one of the many local clubs\nthat would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He\ndropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations\n(among them Michael Landon and\nJames Stewart), and in 1979 worked\nup the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular\ngig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed\nRodney Dangerfield so much that the\nveteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During\nthis period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he\nhad a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy\ndivorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress\nLauren Holly. Wary of falling into the\nlounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance\noutlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived\nsitcom\nThe Duck Factory (1984);\nwhile the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to\npursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored\nthe male lead in the ill-received\nLauren Hutton vehicle\n\u041E\u0434\u043D\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0432\u043A\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0438\u0439 (1985), and had a\nsupporting role in\n\u041F\u0435\u0491\u0491\u0456 \u0421\u044C\u044E \u0432\u0438\u0439\u0448\u043B\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043C\u0456\u0436 (1986),\nbefore making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc\nin\nEarth Girls Are Easy (1988).\nImpressed with Carrey\u0026#39;s lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial\nDamon Wayans made a call to his brother,\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the\nprocess of putting together the sketch comedy show\nIn Living Color (1990).\nCarrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with\noutrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire\nMarshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill-\nadvised safety tips).Following his time on\nIn Living Color (1990),\nCarrey\u0026#39;s transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened\nwithin the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn\nin\n\u0415\u0439\u0441 \u0412\u0435\u043D\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430: \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043A\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0437 \u0440\u043E\u0437\u0448\u0443\u043A\u0443 \u0434\u043E\u043C\u0430\u0448\u043D\u0456\u0445 \u0442\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043D (1994),\na film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the\ncharacter\u0026#39;s trademark was talking out his derri\u00E8re). Next up was the\nmanic superhero movie \u041C\u0430\u0441\u043A\u0430 (1994),\nwhich had audiences wondering just how far Carrey\u0026#39;s features could\nstretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the\nFarrelly brothers\u0026#39;\n\u0422\u0443\u043F\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430 \u0449\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u043F\u0456\u0448\u0438\u0439 (1994) (his first\nmulti-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought\nhis manic antics onto the set of\n\u0411\u0435\u0442\u043C\u0435\u043D \u043D\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0436\u0434\u0438 (1995), replacing\nRobin Williams as The Riddler. He\nalso filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough,\n\u0415\u0439\u0441 \u0412\u0435\u043D\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430: \u041F\u043E\u043A\u043B\u0438\u043A \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043E\u0434\u0438 (1995),\nand inked a deal with Sony to star in\n\u041A\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0438\u043A (1996) (replacing\nChris Farley) for a cool $20\nmillion--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been\noffered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a\ndisappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced\nback the next year with the energetic hit\n\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0443\u043D, \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0443\u043D (1997). Worried that his\ncomic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in\nPeter Weir\u0026#39;s\n\u0428\u043E\u0443 \u0422\u0440\u0443\u043C\u0435\u043D\u0430 (1998) playing a\nnaive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a\nTV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took\nmoviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and\nfans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn\u0026#39;t\nmaterialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their\nnarrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey\nthrew himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a\nhandful of other hopefuls (including\nEdward Norton) to play eccentric\nfunnyman Andy Kaufman in\n\u041B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430 \u0437 \u041C\u0456\u0441\u044F\u0446\u044F (1999), Carrey\ndisappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery\nalter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman\u0026#39;s bongo\ndrums, which he\u0026#39;d used during his audition for director\nMilos Forman). His sometimes uncanny\nimpersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again\nthe Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly\nbrothers in\n\u042F, \u0437\u043D\u043E\u0432\u0443 \u044F \u0442\u0430 \u0406\u0440\u0435\u043D (2000),\nplaying a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall\nin love with the same woman\n(Ren\u00E9e Zellweger). Carrey\u0026#39;s real-life\npersona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film\nwrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then,\nCarrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy\nantihero of Ron Howard\u0026#39;s\n\u042F\u043A \u0490\u0440\u0456\u043D\u0447 \u0432\u0438\u043A\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0420\u0456\u0437\u0434\u0432\u043E (2000).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films\nsuch as \u0411\u0440\u044E\u0441 \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043C\u043E\u0433\u0443\u0442\u043D\u0456\u0439 (2003) and\n\u041F\u0456\u043D\u0433\u0432\u0456\u043D\u0438 \u043C\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u041F\u043E\u043F\u043F\u0435\u0440\u0430 (2011),\nhe is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as\ndemonstrated in films like\n\u0412\u0456\u0447\u043D\u0435 \u0441\u044F\u0439\u0432\u043E \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0440\u043E\u0437\u0443\u043C\u0443 (2004)\nand the drama/comedy \u0417\u0430\u0432\u0436\u0434\u0438 \u043A\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0422\u0410\u041A (2008). In\n2013, he costars with Steve Carell in\n\u041D\u0435\u0439\u043C\u043E\u0432\u0456\u0440\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u043D\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0443\u043D (2013).Carrey has one child with his first wife,\nMelissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995.\nHe married actress Lauren Holly in 1996,\nbut they split less than a year later.",

    "Info": "Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio\u0026#39;s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as \u0417\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043A\u0438 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as \u0420\u043E\u043C\u0435\u043E \u002B \u0414\u0436\u0443\u043B\u044C\u0454\u0442\u0442\u0430 (1996) and \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0456\u043A (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n\u00E9e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \u0026quot;Wilhelm\u0026quot;, was his maternal grandfather\u0026#39;s first name. Leonardo\u0026#39;s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late \u0026#39;Harvey Pekar\u0026#39;, a friend of George\u0026#39;s. Leonardo\u0026#39;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \u0026quot;Lenny Williams\u0026quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn\u0026#39;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in \u0417\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043A\u0438 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While \u0417\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043A\u0438 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio\u0026#39;s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \u0026quot;Cousin Oliver\u0026quot; role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio\u0026#39;s stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public\u0026#39;s attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in \u0429\u043E \u0433\u043D\u0456\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044C \u0490\u0456\u043B\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0490\u0440\u0435\u0439\u043F\u0430 (1993), a young gunslinger in \u0428\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430 \u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in \u0429\u043E\u0434\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0438\u043A \u0431\u0430\u0441\u043A\u0435\u0442\u0431\u043E\u043B\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo\u0026#39;s reputation as an actor, it wasn\u0026#39;t until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann\u0026#39;s \u0420\u043E\u043C\u0435\u043E \u002B \u0414\u0436\u0443\u043B\u044C\u0454\u0442\u0442\u0430 (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0456\u043A (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0456\u043A (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio\u0026#39;s reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043D\u0456\u043A (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in \u041B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043B\u0456\u0437\u043D\u0456\u0439 \u043C\u0430\u0441\u0446\u0456 (1998) and the low-budget \u041F\u043B\u044F\u0436 (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in \u0412\u043F\u0456\u0439\u043C\u0430\u0439 \u043C\u0435\u043D\u0435, \u044F\u043A\u0449\u043E \u0437\u043C\u043E\u0436\u0435\u0448 (2002) and \u0411\u0430\u043D\u0434\u0438 \u041D\u044C\u044E-\u0419\u043E\u0440\u043A\u0430 (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as \u0412\u0456\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043F\u043D\u0438\u043A\u0438 (2006), \u041E\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u043F\u0440\u043E\u043A\u043B\u044F\u0442\u0438\u0445 (2010) and Christopher Nolan\u0026#39;s \u041F\u043E\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043E\u043A (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich\u00E9 about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in \u0414\u0436\u0430\u043D\u0433\u043E \u0432\u0456\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0438\u0439 (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in \u0412\u0435\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0490\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0431\u0456 (2013) and Jordan Belfort in \u0412\u043E\u0432\u043A \u0437 \u0412\u043E\u043B\u043B-\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0442 (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.",

    "Info": "In 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in \u041D\u0435\u0441\u043A\u0456\u043D\u0447\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0435 \u043A\u043E\u0445\u0430\u043D\u043D\u044F (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including \u041D\u0430\u0439\u043A\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043B\u0435\u0446\u044C (1986); \u041A\u043E\u043B\u0456\u0440 \u0433\u0440\u043E\u0448\u0435\u0439 (1986), \u041B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430 \u0434\u043E\u0449\u0443 (1988) and \u041D\u0430\u0440\u043E\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043B\u0438\u043F\u043D\u044F (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as \u0406\u043D\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0026#39;\u044E \u0437 \u0432\u0430\u043C\u043F\u0456\u0440\u043E\u043C: \u0425\u0440\u043E\u043D\u0456\u043A\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u044F \u0432\u0430\u043C\u043F\u0456\u0440\u0430 (1994), \u041C\u0456\u0441\u0456\u044F \u043D\u0435\u043C\u043E\u0436\u043B\u0438\u0432\u0430 (1996) and \u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0456 \u041C\u0430\u0433\u0443\u0430\u0439\u0435\u0440 (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor.

    "Info": "Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born in Paris, France, to British parents, Jacqueline Luesby and Chris Watson, both lawyers. She moved to Oxfordshire when she was five, where she attended the Dragon School. The same year, she was diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Ritalin as she struggled to sit still. From the age of six, Emma knew that she wanted to be an actress and, for a number of years, she trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed and taken the lead in various Stagecoach productions and school plays.In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (2001), the film adaptation of British author J.K.

    "Info": "Christopher Robert Evans is an American actor, film producer, and director. Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative Mike Capuano. Chris\u0026#39;s father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris\u0026#39;s mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \u0026quot;Leontes\u0026quot; in \u0026quot;The Winter\u0026#39;s Tale\u0026quot; as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \u0026quot;Guilt\u0026quot;, Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in \u0412\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0443 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0456-\u0424\u043E\u043B\u0441 (1999) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in \u0411\u043E\u0441\u0442\u043E\u043D\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0430 \u0448\u043A\u043E\u043B\u0430 (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, \u041D\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044F\u0447\u0435 \u043A\u0456\u043D\u043E (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - \u041C\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0434\u044F\u0442\u0430 (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, \u0412\u0438\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043B (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, \u0421\u0442\u0456\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0439 (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman\u0026#39;s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, \u0421\u0442\u0456\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0439 (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in \u0424\u0430\u043D\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043D\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0456\u0440\u043A\u0430 (2005), 20th Century Fox\u0026#39;s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance.

    "Info": "William Bradley \u0026quot;Brad\u0026quot; Pitt was born on December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma and raised in Springfield, Missouri to Jane Etta Pitt (n\u00E9e Hillhouse), a school counselor \u0026amp; William Alvin \u0026quot;Bill\u0026quot; Pitt, a truck company manager. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for El Pollo Loco.Pitt\u0026#39;s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in \u0422\u0435\u043B\u044C\u043C\u0430 \u0456 \u041B\u0443\u0457\u0437\u0430 (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) \u0026amp; \u041A\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442 (1992).But Pitt\u0026#39;s career hit an upswing with his casting in \u0422\u0430\u043C, \u0434\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435 \u0440\u0456\u043A\u0430 (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt\u0026#39;s subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in \u0421\u043F\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0436\u043D\u0454 \u043A\u043E\u0445\u0430\u043D\u043D\u044F (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as \u0406\u043D\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0026#39;\u044E \u0437 \u0432\u0430\u043C\u043F\u0456\u0440\u043E\u043C: \u0425\u0440\u043E\u043D\u0456\u043A\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u044F \u0432\u0430\u043C\u043F\u0456\u0440\u0430 (1994) and \u041B\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043D\u0434\u0438 \u043E\u0441\u0435\u043D\u0456 (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller \u0421\u0456\u043C (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in \u0414\u0432\u0430\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u043C\u0430\u0432\u043F (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt\u0026#39;s portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama \u0422\u0440\u043E\u044F (2004) helped establish his appeal as an action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick \u041C\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0456 \u043C\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0441 \u0421\u043C\u0456\u0442 (2005). It was on the set of Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as \u041C\u0435\u0433\u0430\u043C\u043E\u0437\u043E\u043A (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0441\u043B\u0430\u0432\u043D\u0456 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u043E\u0434\u043A\u0438 (2009) and \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043E \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0442\u044F (2011).

    "Info": "Considered to be one of the most pivotal stars of the early days of Hollywood, Charlie Chaplin lived an interesting life both in his films and behind the camera. He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother, Syd Chaplin spent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother\u0026#39;s bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.Chaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with Fred Karno\u0026#39;s vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe\u0026#39;s 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios\u0026#39; popular comedy director Mack Sennett, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.In November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists (UA).Chaplin\u0026#39;s life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, at which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a \u0026quot;paying visitor\u0026quot; to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin\u0026#39;s later film \u0412\u0435\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u043A\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 (1940), which was his first \u0026quot;talkie\u0026quot;, also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of Adolf Hitler. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.Another scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22 year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin\u0026#39;s relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence, and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.Chaplin also was scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of \u0412\u043E\u0433\u043D\u0456 \u0440\u0430\u043C\u043F\u0438 (1952), he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.Chaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married Mildred Harris and they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who lived only three days. Chaplin and Harris divorced in 1920. He married Lita Grey in 1924, who had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married Paulette Goddard, and his final marriage was to Oona O\u0026#39;Neill (Oona Chaplin), daughter of playwright Eugene O\u0026#39;Neill in 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children: Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Chaplin, Josephine Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin, and Christopher Chaplin.In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an \u0026quot;un-millionaire\u0026quot; way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his \u0026quot;incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century\u0026quot;. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year\u0026#39;s Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads \u0026quot;Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer\u0026quot;.Chaplin\u0026#39;s other works included musical scores that he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \u0026quot;My Autobiography\u0026quot; (1964) and its companion volume, \u0026quot;My Life in Pictures\u0026quot; (1974).Chaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin\u0026#39;s corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.Six of Chaplin\u0026#39;s films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), \u041C\u0430\u043B\u044E\u043A (1921), \u0417\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0442\u0430 \u043B\u0438\u0445\u043E\u043C\u0430\u043D\u043A\u0430 (1925), \u0412\u043E\u0433\u043D\u0456 \u0432\u0435\u043B\u0438\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043C\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430 (1931), \u041D\u043E\u0432\u0456 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0438 (1936), and \u0412\u0435\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u043A\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 (1940).Charlie Chaplin is considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp\u0026#39;s positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.",

    "Info": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother\u0026#39;s family, originally surnamed \u0026quot;Fraga\u0026quot;, was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \u0026quot;fractured\u0026quot; family. He moved around a great deal after his parents\u0026#39; divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on \u0421\u043F\u043B\u0435\u0441\u043A (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character\u0026#39;s wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy \u0422\u0435\u043D\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u043B\u0430 (1987), Hanks\u0026#39; stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy \u0412\u0435\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0438\u0439 (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in \u0407\u0445\u043D\u044F \u0432\u043B\u0430\u0441\u043D\u0430 \u043B\u0456\u0433\u0430 (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \u0026quot;modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\u0026quot;. This \u0026quot;modern era\u0026quot; began for Hanks, first with \u0411\u0435\u0437\u0441\u043E\u043D\u043D\u044F \u0432 \u0421\u0456\u0435\u0442\u043B\u0456 (1993) and then with \u0424\u0456\u043B\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043B\u044C\u0444\u0456\u044F (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \u0026quot;charming\u0026quot;, and most critics agreed that Hanks\u0026#39; portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \u0026quot;Above all, credit for Philadelphia\u0026#39;s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\u0026quot; Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster \u0424\u043E\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0490\u0430\u043C\u043F (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \u0026quot;When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\u0026quot; Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks\u0026#39; next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama \u0410\u043F\u043E\u043B\u043B\u043E\u043D 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar\u0026#39;s computer-animated film \u0406\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0456\u044F \u0456\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043E\u043A (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy \u0422\u0435, \u0449\u043E \u0442\u0438 \u0440\u043E\u0431\u0438\u0448 (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.As of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old.

That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in \u0428\u0443\u043B\u0435\u0440\u0438 (1998), starring opposite Edward Norton and John Malkovich.

Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also starred in the movie. \u0422\u0430\u043B\u0430\u043D\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u043C\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u0420\u0456\u043F\u043B\u0456 (1999) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance. Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043D: \u041F\u0456\u0441\u043B\u044F \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0435\u043B\u0456 \u0417\u0435\u043C\u043B\u0456 (2000) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, \u041D\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043C\u043D\u0456 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0446\u044F (2000) and the golf comedy-drama, \u041B\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043D\u0434\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u043D\u0441\u0430 (2000), starring alongside Will Smith.

(2009) by Steven Soderbergh and the Farrelly Brothers\u0026#39; \u0417\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044F\u0433 \u0443 \u0442\u043E\u0431\u0456 (2003). He also starred in Gerry (2002), a film he co-wrote with his friends, Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck. One of Matt\u0026#39;s most recognizable work to date is his role in the \u0026quot;Bourne\u0026quot; movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, \u0026quot;Jason Bourne\u0026quot;, in \u0406\u0434\u0435\u043D\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0456\u043A\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044F \u0411\u043E\u0440\u043D\u0430 (2002), \u041F\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0433\u0430 \u0411\u043E\u0440\u043D\u0430 (2004) and \u0423\u043B\u044C\u0442\u0438\u043C\u0430\u0442\u0443\u043C \u0411\u043E\u0440\u043D\u0430 (2007). Another praised role is that as \u0026quot;Linus Caldwell\u0026quot; in the \u0026quot;Ocean\u0026#39;s\u0026quot; movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle in \u041E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2001). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, \u0414\u0432\u0430\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2004) and \u0422\u0440\u0438\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2007).

    "Info": "Sylvester Stallone is an athletically built, dark-haired American actor/screenwriter/director/producer, the movie fans worldwide have been flocking to see Stallone\u0026#39;s films for over 40 years, making \u0026quot;Sly\u0026quot; one of Hollywood\u0026#39;s biggest-ever box office draws.Sylvester Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York\u0026#39;s gritty\nHell\u0026#39;s Kitchen, to Jackie Stallone (n\u00E9e\nLabofish), an astrologer, and\nFrank Stallone, a beautician\nand hairdresser. His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother\u0026#39;s\nheritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The\nyoung Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and\nThe University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he\nstruggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core\nThe Party at Kitty and Stud\u0026#39;s (1970),\nthe thriller \u041A\u043B\u044E\u0442 (1971) and the comedy\nBananas (1971). He got a crucial career\nbreak alongside fellow young actor\nHenry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the\neffectively written teen gang film\nThe Lords of Flatbush (1974).\nFurther film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring\nproductions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac,\nbloodthirsty race driver named \u0026quot;Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\u0026quot; in the\nRoger Corman-produced\n\u0421\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0456 \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043E\u043D\u0438 2000 \u0440\u043E\u043A\u0443 (1975). However,\nStallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an\nactor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in\nCleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given\nthe \u0026quot;million to one opportunity\u0026quot; to challenge for the heavyweight\ntitle. \u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 (1976) became the stuff of\ncinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the\nBest Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially\nsuccessful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly\ndeserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from\nfellow cast members Talia Shire,\nBurgess Meredith and\nBurt Young, and director\nJohn G. Avildsen gave the film an\nemotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived\non his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure\nHollywood\u0026#39;s hottest new star.Stallone followed \u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 (1976) with\n\u041A\u0443\u043B\u0430\u043A (1978), loosely based on the life\nof Teamsters boss \u0026quot;Jimmy Hoffa\u0026quot;, and\nParadise Alley (1978) before\npulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the\nsequel \u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 II (1979). The second\nouting for the \u0026quot;Italian Stallion\u0026quot; wasn\u0026#39;t as powerful or successful as\nthe first \u0026quot;Rocky\u0026quot;, however, it still produced strong box office.\nSubsequent films \u041D\u0456\u0447\u043D\u0456 \u044F\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0438 (1981) and\n\u0412\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0430 \u0434\u043E \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043C\u043E\u0433\u0438 (1981) failed to ignite with\naudiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory\nwith \u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 III (1982) and a fearsome\nopponent in \u0026quot;Clubber Lang\u0026quot; played by muscular ex-bodyguard\nMr. T. The third \u0026quot;Rocky\u0026quot; installment far\noutperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone\nretired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another\nseries was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret \u0026quot;John Rambo\u0026quot; was the creation of\nCanadian-born writer\nDavid Morrell, and his novel was\nadapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in\n\u0420\u0435\u043C\u0431\u043E: \u041F\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430 \u043A\u0440\u043E\u0432 (1982), also starring\nRichard Crenna and\nBrian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise\nhit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the\nVietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public\u0026#39;s\npsyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and\na sequel soon followed with\n\u0420\u0435\u043C\u0431\u043E: \u041F\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430 \u043A\u0440\u043E\u0432. \u0427\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043D\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 (1985),\nwhich drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the\nfilm\u0026#39;s plot line about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam.\nBut they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \u0026quot;John\nRambo\u0026#39;s\u0026quot; second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and\ncemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave\nof amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky\nBalboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a\nSoviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \u0026quot;Ivan\nDrago\u0026quot; played by curt Dolph Lundgren in\n\u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 IV (1985). The fourth outing was\nsomewhat controversial with \u0026quot;Rocky\u0026quot; fans, as violence levels seemed\nexcessive compared to previous \u0026quot;Rocky\u0026quot; films, especially with the\nsavage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by\nCarl Weathers, at the hands of the\nunstoppable \u0026quot;Siberian Express\u0026quot;.Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films\nthat met with a mixed reception from his fans.\n\u041A\u043E\u0431\u0440\u0430 (1986) was a clumsy mess,\n\u0429\u043E\u0441\u0438\u043B\u0438 (1987) was equally\nmediocre, \u0420\u0435\u043C\u0431\u043E III (1988) saw Rambo\ntake on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film\n\u0422\u0430\u043D\u0433\u043E \u0456 \u041A\u0435\u0448 (1989) just did not\nquite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there\nwas chemistry between Stallone and co-star\nKurt Russell.Philadelphia\u0026#39;s favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his\nfifth screen outing in \u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 V (1990)\ntackling Tommy \u0026quot;Machine\u0026quot; Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter\nTommy Morrison, the great-nephew\nof screen legend John Wayne. Sly\nquickly followed with the lukewarm comedy\n\u041E\u0441\u043A\u0430\u0440 (1991), the painfully unfunny\n\u0421\u0442\u0456\u0439! \u0411\u043E \u043C\u043E\u044F \u043C\u0430\u043C\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043B\u044F\u0442\u0438\u043C\u0435 (1992),\nthe futuristic action film\n\u0420\u0443\u0439\u043D\u0456\u0432\u043D\u0438\u043A (1993), and the\ncomic book-inspired\n\u0421\u0443\u0434\u0434\u044F \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0434 (1995). Interestingly,\nStallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he\nhad been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more\ndramatically challenging role in the intriguing\n\u041F\u043E\u043B\u0456\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0456 (1997), also starring\nRobert De Niro and\nRay Liotta. It isn\u0026#39;t a classic of the genre,\nbut \u041F\u043E\u043B\u0456\u0446\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0456 (1997) certainly surprised\nmany critics with Stallone\u0026#39;s understated performance. Stallone then\nlent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story\n\u041C\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0445\u0430 \u0410\u043D\u0442\u0446 (1998), reprised the role made famous\nby Michael Caine in a terrible\nremake of \u041F\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u041A\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 (2000), climbed\nback into a race car for \u0413\u043E\u043D\u0449\u0438\u043A (2001),\nand guest-starred as the \u0026quot;Toymaker\u0026quot; in the third chapter of the\nimmensely popular \u0026quot;Spy Kids\u0026quot; film series,\n\u0414\u0456\u0442\u0438 \u0448\u043F\u0438\u0433\u0443\u043D\u0456\u0432 3: \u041A\u0456\u043D\u0435\u0446\u044C \u0433\u0440\u0438 (2003).\nShowing that age had not wearied his two most popular series,\nStallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky\nBalboa to star in, well, what else but\n\u0420\u043E\u043A\u043A\u0456 \u0411\u0430\u043B\u044C\u0431\u043E\u0430 (2006), and Vietnam\nveteran \u0420\u0435\u043C\u0431\u043E IV (2008) will reappear after a\n20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and\nhighly respected career in Hollywood, plus, he has considerably\ninfluenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film\ncharacters.",

    "Info": "Willard Carroll \u0026quot;Will\u0026quot; Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter. He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him \u0026quot;the most powerful actor in Hollywood\u0026quot;. Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia\u0026#39;s Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \u0026quot;wanted to rap.\u0026quot; Smith says he was admitted to a \u0026quot;pre-engineering [summer] program\u0026quot; at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \u0026quot;My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college.\u0026quot;Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff \u0026amp; The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey \u0026quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff\u0026quot; Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably \u0026quot;Parents Just Don\u0026#39;t Understand\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Summertime\u0026quot;. They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming \u0026quot;the biggest movie star in the world\u0026quot;, studying box office successes\u0026#39; common characteristics.\nSmith\u0026#39;s first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich\u0026#39;s Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.

Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves\u0026#39;s performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \u0026quot;made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\u0026quot;In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman\u0026#39;s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be \u0026quot;aggressively unique\u0026quot;. A reviewer said that the film\u0026#39;s commercial success \u0026quot;cemented [Smith\u0026#39;s] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood.\u0026quot; On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America\u0026#39;s top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa.

Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game.

CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death. Smith\u0026#39;s involvement is mostly due to his last-minute exit from the Sci-Fi thriller-drama Brilliance. Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania.

    "Info": "Clinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (n\u00E9e Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.During the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as \u041F\u043E\u043C\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0406\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0442\u0438 (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood\u0026#39;s big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone\u0026#39;s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: \u0417\u0430 \u0436\u043C\u0435\u043D\u044E \u0434\u043E\u043B\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432 (1964), \u041D\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043A\u0456\u043B\u044C\u043A\u0430 \u0434\u043E\u043B\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u0431\u0456\u043B\u044C\u0448\u0435 (1965), and \u0425\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0448\u0438\u0439, \u043F\u043E\u0433\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0439, \u0437\u043B\u0438\u0439 (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood\u0026#39;s character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star\u0026#39;s first U.S.-made western, Hang \u0026#39;Em High (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan\u0026#39;s Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic \u041A\u0443\u0434\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043B\u0456\u0442\u0430\u044E\u0442\u044C \u0442\u0456\u043B\u044C\u043A\u0438 \u043E\u0440\u043B\u0438 (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043E\u0457 \u041A\u0435\u043B\u043B\u0456 (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in \u0411\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0456 (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels \u0421\u0438\u043B\u0430 \u041C\u0430\u0433\u043D\u0443\u043C\u0430 (1973) and \u041F\u0456\u0434\u043A\u0440\u0456\u043F\u043B\u0435\u043D\u043D\u044F (1976), the action-packed road adventures \u0411\u043B\u0438\u0441\u043A\u0430\u0432\u043A\u0430 \u0456 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043D\u0435\u0446\u044C (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the prison film \u0412\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0430 \u0437 \u0410\u043B\u044C\u043A\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0443 (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with \u042F\u043A \u043D\u0435 \u043A\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438 - \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0454\u0448 (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.Eastwood kicked off the 1980s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, \u0420\u0430\u043F\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440 (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \u0026quot;Make my day.\u0026quot; He also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), \u0422\u043E\u0439, \u0449\u043E \u0439\u0434\u0435 \u043F\u043E \u043A\u0430\u043D\u0430\u0442\u0443 (1984), City Heat (1984), \u0406\u043C\u0026#39;\u044F \u0439\u043E\u043C\u0443 \u0421\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044C (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, \u0413\u0440\u0430 \u0443 \u0441\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u044C (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like \u0420\u043E\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043A\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043B\u0430\u043A (1989) and \u041D\u043E\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043E\u043A (1990), it seemed Eastwood\u0026#39;s star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing \u041F\u0442\u0430\u0445 (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing \u0411\u0456\u043B\u0438\u0439 \u043C\u0438\u0441\u043B\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0446\u044C, \u0447\u043E\u0440\u043D\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0446\u0435 (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).Eastwood bounced back big time with his dark western \u041D\u0435\u043F\u0440\u043E\u0449\u0435\u043D\u043D\u0438\u0439 (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in \u041D\u0430 \u043B\u0456\u043D\u0456\u0457 \u0432\u043E\u0433\u043D\u044E (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received \u0406\u0434\u0435\u0430\u043B\u044C\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442 (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, \u041C\u043E\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043E\u043A\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0443 \u041C\u0435\u0434\u0456\u0441\u043E\u043D (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. \u0410\u0431\u0441\u043E\u043B\u044E\u0442\u043D\u0430 \u0432\u043B\u0430\u0434\u0430 (1997) and \u041A\u043E\u0441\u043C\u0456\u0447\u043D\u0456 \u043A\u043E\u0432\u0431\u043E\u0457 (2000) did well enough, while \u0421\u043F\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0436\u043D\u0456\u0439 \u0437\u043B\u043E\u0447\u0438\u043D (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was \u041E\u043F\u0456\u0432\u043D\u043E\u0447\u0456 \u0443 \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u043E\u0431\u0440\u0430 \u0456 \u0437\u043B\u0430 (1997), which he directed but didn\u0026#39;t appear in.Eastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with \u041A\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0456\u0442\u043A\u0430 \u043D\u0430 \u043C\u0456\u043B\u044C\u0439\u043E\u043D \u0434\u043E\u043B\u0430\u0440\u0456\u0432 (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043D \u0422\u043E\u0440\u0456\u043D\u043E (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood \u0026amp; Company (2012).Between acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed \u0422\u0430\u0454\u043C\u043D\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0440\u0456\u0447\u043A\u0430 (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), \u041F\u0440\u0430\u043F\u043E\u0440\u0438 \u043D\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u044C\u043A\u0456\u0432 (2006), \u041B\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437 \u0406\u0432\u043E\u0434\u0437\u0456\u043C\u0438 (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), \u041F\u0456\u0434\u043C\u0456\u043D\u0430 (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), \u041D\u0435\u043F\u0456\u0434\u043A\u043E\u0440\u0435\u043D\u0438\u0439 (2009) (again with Freeman), \u041F\u043E\u0442\u043E\u0439\u0431\u0456\u0447\u043D\u0435 (2010), \u0414\u0436. \u0415\u0434\u0433\u0430\u0440 (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), \u0410\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043A\u0430\u043D\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043D\u0430\u0439\u043F\u0435\u0440 (2014) (2014\u0026#39;s top box office champ), \u0421\u0430\u043B\u043B\u0456 (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and \u041F\u043E\u0457\u0437\u0434 \u0434\u043E \u041F\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0430 (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in \u041D\u0430\u0440\u043A\u043E\u043A\u0443\u0440\u0026#39;\u0454\u0440 (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed \u0420\u0456\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u0414\u0436\u0443\u0435\u043B\u043B (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of \u0427\u043E\u043B\u043E\u0432\u0456\u0447\u0456 \u0441\u043B\u044C\u043E\u0437\u0438 (2021).Away from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.His known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho\u0026#39;s Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.",

She returned to main stream films in \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0456\u043B\u043B\u044F \u043D\u0430\u0439\u043A\u0440\u0430\u0449\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430 (1997), in which she held her own against veteran actress Julia Roberts. She earned full fledged star status in 1998 for her performance in the box office smash \u0412\u0441\u0456 \u0448\u0430\u043B\u0435\u043D\u0456\u044E\u0442\u044C \u0432\u0456\u0434 \u041C\u0435\u0440\u0456 (1998). With her name near the top on virtually every list of Hollyood\u0026#39;s sexiest actresses, and firmly established as one of filmdom\u0026#39;s hottest properties and most sought after actresses, Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become one of the super stars of the new century.",

    "Info": "George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (n\u00E9e Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.After his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Sisters (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series \u0428\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043A\u0430 \u0434\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043C\u043E\u0433\u0430 (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.While filming \u0026quot;ER\u0026quot; (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez\u0026#39;s \u0412\u0456\u0434 \u0441\u0443\u0442\u0456\u043D\u043A\u0456\u0432 \u0434\u043E \u0441\u0432\u0456\u0442\u0430\u043D\u043A\u0443 (1996), and \u041E\u0434\u043D\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043E\u0432\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0434\u043D\u044F (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer.

The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh\u0026#39;s \u041F\u043E\u0437\u0430 \u043F\u043E\u043B\u0435\u043C \u0437\u043E\u0440\u0443 (1998), Terrence Malick\u0026#39;s \u0422\u043E\u043D\u043A\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043E\u043D\u0430 \u043B\u0456\u043D\u0456\u044F (1998), and David O.

Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, Ocean\u0026#39;s Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: \u0414\u0432\u0430\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2004) and \u0422\u0440\u0438\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2007).In 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with \u0421\u043F\u043E\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044C \u043D\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043F\u0435\u0447\u043D\u043E\u0457 \u043B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0438 (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris\u0026#39; autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of Section Eight Productions, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including \u0414\u0430\u043B\u0435\u043A\u043E \u0432\u0456\u0434 \u0440\u0430\u044E (2002), \u0421\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043D\u0430 (2005), \u0417\u0430\u0442\u044C\u043C\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043D\u043D\u044F (2006) and \u0414\u043E\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043D\u0456\u0447, \u0456 \u043D\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0439 \u0449\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044C. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana (2005), and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck.

Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in Up in the Air (2009) and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award. He didn\u0026#39;t win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne\u0026#39;s \u041D\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0434\u043A\u0438 (2011). Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake.

After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn\u0026#39;t have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney, with whom he has two children, twins.",

    "Info": "One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood\u0026#39;s best known\ndirector and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with \u0429\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043F\u0438 (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped\nout to pursue his entertainment career.\nAmong his\nearly directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World\nWar II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes\nyou believe is moving. He also directed\nEscape to Nowhere (1961), which\nfeatured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister\nAnne Spielberg, and\nThe Last Gun (1959), a western.\nAll of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg\ndirected a couple of movies that would portend his future career in\nmovies. In 1964, he directed\n\u041F\u043E\u043B\u0443\u043C\u0026#39;\u044F \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0456 (1964), a movie about aliens\ninvading a small town. In 1967, he directed\nSlipstream (1967), which was\nunfinished. However, in 1968, he directed\nAmblin\u0026#39; (1968), which featured the desert\nprominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would\nfeature. Amblin\u0026#39; also became the name of his production\ncompany, which turned out such classics as\n\u0406\u043D\u0448\u043E\u043F\u043B\u0430\u043D\u0435\u0442\u044F\u043D\u0438\u043D (1982).\nSpielberg had a unique and classic early directing project,\n\u0414\u0443\u0435\u043B\u044C (1971), with\nDennis Weaver. In the early 1970s,\nSpielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as\nRod Serling\u0026#39;s\nNight Gallery (1969),\nMarcus Welby, M.D. (1969)\nand\nMurder by the Book (1971).\nAll of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing\nprojects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would\ndazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg\u0026#39;s first major directorial effort was\n\u0428\u0443\u0491\u0430\u0440\u043B\u0435\u043D\u0434\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0435\u043A\u0441\u043F\u0440\u0435\u0441 (1974),\nwith Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as\na rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an\ninternational superstar among directors:\n\u0429\u0435\u043B\u0435\u043F\u0438 (1975). This classic shark attack tale\nstarted the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was\ncredited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic\n\u0411\u043B\u0438\u0437\u044C\u043A\u0456 \u043A\u043E\u043D\u0442\u0430\u043A\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044C\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043F\u0435\u043D\u044F (1977),\na unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978,\nSpielberg produced his first film, the forgettable\nI Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978),\nand followed that effort with\n\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0456 \u043C\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043D\u0438 (1980), a critically\nacclaimed, but mostly forgotten,\nKurt Russell/Jack Warden\ncomedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more\ntime with\n\u0406\u043D\u0434\u0456\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043E\u043D\u0441: \u0423 \u043F\u043E\u0448\u0443\u043A\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043D\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043A\u043E\u0432\u0447\u0435\u0433\u0430 (1981),\nwith Harrison Ford taking the part\nof Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982.\nThe first was \u041F\u043E\u043B\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442 (1982), but\nthe highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien\nstory\n\u0406\u043D\u0448\u043E\u043F\u043B\u0430\u043D\u0435\u0442\u044F\u043D\u0438\u043D (1982).\nSpielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The\nconcept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when\nSpielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or\ninfamous) placement of Reese\u0026#39;s Pieces in \u0026quot;E.T.\u0026quot; Spielberg was also one\nof the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \u0026quot;E.T.\u0026quot;\nand \u0026quot;Close Encounters\u0026quot;, where a very strong emphasis on special effects\nwas placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg\nfollowed up \u0026quot;Raiders\u0026quot; with\n\u0406\u043D\u0434\u0456\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043E\u043D\u0441 \u0456 \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043C \u0434\u043E\u043B\u0456 (1984),\nwhich was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim\nof its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in\nthe 1980s, such as\n\u0411\u043E\u0432\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0438 (1985), and was the\nbrains behind the little monsters in\n\u0490\u0440\u0435\u043C\u043B\u0456\u043D\u0438 (1984). He also produced the\ncartoon\n\u0410\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043A\u0430\u043D\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442 (1986), a\nquaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,\nhowever, was the blockbuster\n\u041D\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0443 \u043C\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0443\u0442\u043D\u0454 (1985),\nwhich made Michael J. Fox an\ninstant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book\n\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0432\u0430 \u043F\u0443\u0440\u043F\u0443\u0440\u043E\u0432\u0430 (1985), with\nWhoopi Goldberg and\nOprah Winfrey, with great success. In the\nlatter half of the 1980s, he also directed\n\u0406\u043C\u043F\u0435\u0440\u0456\u044F \u0441\u043E\u043D\u0446\u044F (1987), a\nmixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not\nescape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg\u0026#39;s projects at the center of pop-culture\nyet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film\n\u0425\u0442\u043E \u043F\u0456\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0432 \u043A\u0440\u043E\u043B\u0438\u043A\u0430 \u0420\u043E\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0430 (1988).\nThe next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he\nproduced and directed \u0417\u0430\u0432\u0436\u0434\u0438 (1989) as\nwell as\n\u0406\u043D\u0434\u0456\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043E\u043D\u0441 \u0456 \u043E\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043D\u043D\u0456\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043F\u043E\u0445\u0456\u0434 (1989),\nand\n\u041D\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0443 \u043C\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0443\u0442\u043D\u0454 2 (1989).\nAll three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in\n1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama\n\u0422\u0430\u0442\u043E (1989), with\nJack Lemmon and\nTed Danson, which got mostly mixed results.\nSpielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong\nvoice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \u0026quot;Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit\u0026quot;, he produced the animated series\n\u041F\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043E\u0434\u0438 \u043C\u0443\u043B\u044C\u0442\u044F\u0448\u043E\u043A (1990),\n\u041C\u0443\u043B\u044C\u0442\u0438\u043C\u0430\u043D\u0456\u044F (1993),\nPinky and the Brain (1995),\nFreakazoid! (1995),\nPinky, Elmyra \u0026amp; the Brain (1998),\nFamily Dog (1993) and\nToonsylvania (1998). Spielberg\nalso produced other cartoons such as\n\u0417\u0435\u043C\u043B\u044F \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0456\u0441\u043D\u0438\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0456\u0432 (1988),\n\u041C\u0438 \u043F\u043E\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043D\u0443\u043B\u0438\u0441\u044F! \u0406\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0456\u044F \u0434\u0438\u043D\u043E\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0456\u0432 (1993),\n\u041A\u0430\u0441\u043F\u0435\u0440 (1995) (the live action version) as\nwell as the live-action version of\n\u0424\u043B\u0456\u043D\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0443\u043D\u0438 (1994), where\nhe was credited as \u0026quot;Steven Spielrock\u0026quot;. Spielberg also produced many\nRoger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs\nand Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s,\nas he directed \u041A\u0430\u043F\u0456\u0442\u0430\u043D \u041A\u0440\u044E\u043A (1991) and produced such\nfilms as the cute fantasy\n\u0414\u0436\u043E \u043F\u0440\u043E\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0443\u043B\u043A\u0430\u043D\u0443 (1990)\nand\n\u0410\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043A\u0430\u043D\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0432\u0456\u0441\u0442 2: \u0424\u0430\u0439\u0432\u0435\u043B \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0454 \u043D\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434 (1991).\nHe also produced the unusual comedy thriller\n\u0410\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043D\u043E\u0444\u043E\u0431\u0456\u044F (1990),\n\u041D\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u0443 \u043C\u0430\u0439\u0431\u0443\u0442\u043D\u0454 3 (1990)\nand\n\u0490\u0440\u0435\u043C\u043B\u0456\u043D\u0438 2: \u041D\u043E\u0432\u0430 \u043F\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0456\u044F (1990).\nWhile these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not\nquite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous\nefforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed\n\u041F\u0430\u0440\u043A \u042E\u0440\u0441\u044C\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0456\u043E\u0434\u0443 (1993), which for a\nshort time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time,\nbut did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big\nbox-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced\nand directed\n\u0421\u043F\u0438\u0441\u043E\u043A \u0428\u0438\u043D\u0434\u043B\u0435\u0440\u0430 (1993), a\nstirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars,\nand also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the\nproduction company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many\nbox-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such\nfilms as\n\u041C\u0430\u0441\u043A\u0430 \u0417\u043E\u0440\u0440\u043E (1998),\n\u041B\u044E\u0434\u0438 \u0432 \u0447\u043E\u0440\u043D\u043E\u043C\u0443 (1997) and\nDeep Impact (1998). However, it was\non the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and\nproduced the epic \u0410\u043C\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0434 (1997), a\nspectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to\nthe fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997.\nThe next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best\nfilms of his career:\n\u0412\u0440\u044F\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u044F\u0434\u043E\u0432\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0420\u0430\u044F\u043D\u0430 (1998), a\nfilm about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect.\nIt was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to\n\u0417\u0430\u043A\u043E\u0445\u0430\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0428\u0435\u043A\u0441\u043F\u0456\u0440 (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including\n\u0415\u0432\u043E\u043B\u044E\u0446\u0456\u044F (2001),\n\u041F\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043D\u043A\u0443 \u043D\u0430 \u043F\u0430\u0433\u043E\u0440\u0431\u0456 (1999) and\n\u0428\u0440\u0435\u043A (2001). he also produced two sequels\nto \u041F\u0430\u0440\u043A \u042E\u0440\u0441\u044C\u043A\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043F\u0435\u0440\u0456\u043E\u0434\u0443 (1993), which were\nfinancially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he\nproduced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a\nfinancial and critical success:\n\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043F\u043E \u0437\u0431\u0440\u043E\u0457 (2001), a\ntale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the\ninvasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was\nback in the director\u0026#39;s chair for\n\u0428\u0442\u0443\u0447\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u043E\u0437\u0443\u043C (2001),\na movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box\noffice and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other\nthings he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series\nSeaQuest DSV (1993), an\nanthology series entitled\n\u0414\u0438\u0432\u043E\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043D\u0456 \u0456\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0456\u0457 (1985),\ncreated the video-game series \u0026quot;Medal of Honor\u0026quot; set during World War\nTwo, and was a starting producer of\n\u0428\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043A\u0430 \u0434\u043E\u043F\u043E\u043C\u043E\u0433\u0430 (1994). Spielberg, if you haven\u0026#39;t\nnoticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and\nTom Hanks collaborated on\nShooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a\ndocumentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a\ndocumentary about the Holocaust called\nA Holocaust szemei (2000).\nWith all of this to Spielberg\u0026#39;s credit, it\u0026#39;s no wonder that he\u0026#39;s looked\nat as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.",

    "Info": "Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (Nidelman), a radio actress, and Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in \u0410\u043C\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043A\u0430\u043D\u0441\u044C\u043A\u0456 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u0442\u0456 (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in \u0417\u043E\u0440\u044F\u043D\u0456 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u043D\u0438: \u0415\u043F\u0456\u0437\u043E\u0434 4 - \u041D\u043E\u0432\u0430 \u043D\u0430\u0434\u0456\u044F (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in \u0406\u043D\u0434\u0456\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043E\u043D\u0441: \u0423 \u043F\u043E\u0448\u0443\u043A\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043D\u043E\u0433\u043E \u043A\u043E\u0432\u0447\u0435\u0433\u0430 (1981).Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in \u0421\u0432\u0456\u0434\u043E\u043A (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in \u0406\u0433\u0440\u0438 \u043F\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0456\u043E\u0442\u0456\u0432 (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in \u0412\u0442\u0456\u043A\u0430\u0447 (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.On March 5, 2015, Ford\u0026#39;s plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.",

    "Info": "Alfredo James \u0026quot;Al\u0026quot; \u0026#39;Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema\u0026#39;s most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.He was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents\u0026#39; home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz\u0026#39;s \u0026quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx\u0026quot;, winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \u0026quot;Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\u0026quot; His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in \u041F\u0430\u043D\u0456\u043A\u0430 \u0432 \u041D\u0456\u0434\u043B \u041F\u0430\u0440\u043A (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in \u0425\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u044C\u043A\u043E (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\u0026#39;Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama \u0421\u0435\u0440\u043F\u0456\u043A\u043E (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film \u0421\u043E\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043F\u043E\u043B\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043D\u044C (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \u0026quot;Best Actor\u0026quot; Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with \u041F\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043E\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0434\u044F \u0434\u043B\u044F \u0432\u0441\u0456\u0445 (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like \u0428\u0443\u043A\u0430\u0447 (1980) and \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0430! \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043E\u0440\u0430! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film \u041E\u0431\u043B\u0438\u0447\u0447\u044F \u0437\u0456 \u0448\u0440\u0430\u043C\u043E\u043C (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking \u041C\u043E\u0440\u0435 \u043A\u043E\u0445\u0430\u043D\u043D\u044F (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino\u0026#39;s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made \u0425\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043D\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u0442\u044C\u043A\u043E 3 (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation \u0414\u0456\u043A \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0456 (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for \u0490\u043B\u0435\u043D\u0491\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0456 \u0490\u043B\u0435\u043D \u0420\u043E\u0441\u0441 (1992). He went into romantic mode for \u0424\u0440\u0435\u043D\u043A\u0456 \u0442\u0430 \u0414\u0436\u043E\u043D\u0456 (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in \u0417\u0430\u043F\u0430\u0445 \u0436\u0456\u043D\u043A\u0438 (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. \u0428\u043B\u044F\u0445 \u041A\u0430\u0440\u043B\u0456\u0442\u043E (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043A\u0430 (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare\u0026#39;s Looking for Richard (1996). During this period, \u041C\u0435\u0440\u0456\u044F (1996), \u0414\u043E\u043D\u043D\u0456 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043A\u043E (1997) and \u0410\u0434\u0432\u043E\u043A\u0430\u0442 \u0434\u0438\u044F\u0432\u043E\u043B\u0430 (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in \u0421\u0432\u043E\u044F \u043B\u044E\u0434\u0438\u043D\u0430 (1999) and \u0429\u043E\u043D\u0435\u0434\u0456\u043B\u0456 (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including \u0422\u0440\u0438\u043D\u0430\u0434\u0446\u044F\u0442\u044C \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0456\u0432 \u041E\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043D\u0430 (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie \u0412\u0438 \u043D\u0435 \u0437\u043D\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435 \u0414\u0436\u0435\u043A\u0430 (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.Never wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D\u0026#39;Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \u0026quot;Godfather\u0026quot; co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Sol\u00E1, who is 36 years his junior.As of 2022, Pacino is 82-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and continues to appear regularly in film.",

    "Info": "Russell Ira Crowe was born in Wellington, New Zealand, to Jocelyn Yvonne (Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe, both of whom catered movie sets. His maternal grandfather, Stanley Wemyss, was a cinematographer. Crowe\u0026#39;s recent ancestry includes Welsh (where his paternal grandfather was born, in Wrexham), English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, and Maori (one of Crowe\u0026#39;s maternal great-grandmothers, Erana Putiputi Hayes Heihi, was Maori).Crowe\u0026#39;s family moved to Australia when he was a small child, settling in Sydney, and Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell\u0026#39;s first big break came with two films ... the first, Romper Stomper (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, The Sum of Us (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Romper Stomper (1992) and wanted him for her film, \u0428\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430 \u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 (1995). But filming on The Sum of Us (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With \u0428\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043A\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0430 \u043C\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0439 (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuosity (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. \u0421\u0435\u043A\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u041B\u043E\u0441-\u0410\u043D\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043B\u0435\u0441\u0430 (1997), Russell\u0026#39;s third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn\u0026#39;t seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, \u0422\u0430\u0454\u043C\u043D\u0438\u0446\u044F \u0410\u043B\u044F\u0441\u043A\u0438 (1999). He achieved even more success and awards for his performances in \u0413\u043B\u0430\u0434\u0456\u0430\u0442\u043E\u0440 (2000), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and \u0406\u0433\u0440\u0438 \u0440\u043E\u0437\u0443\u043C\u0443 (2001).",
