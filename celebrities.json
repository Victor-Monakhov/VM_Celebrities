    "Info": "John Christopher \u0022Johnny\u0022 Depp II was born on June 9, 1963 in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Betty Sue Palmer (n\u00E9e Wells), a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer. He was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named \u0027The Kids\u0027. When he married Lori A. Depp, he took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp\u0027s film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987). In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990). Following the film\u0027s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut\u0027s Wife (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez\u0027s \u0022mariachi\u0022 trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film\u0027s enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Finding Neverland (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl\u0027s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with his former long-time partner, French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and John Christopher \u0022Jack\u0022 III, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015, divorcing a few years later.",

    "Info": "With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who\nwould have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a\nsmall European village would become one of Hollywood\u0027s biggest stars,\nmarry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd\ninvestments and one day be the Governor of California!?The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \u0022rags to\nriches\u0022 tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of\nopportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav\nSchwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a\nkeen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete\nin several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated\nto the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star\nbegan to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather\noddball sport, or even a mis-understood \u0022freak show\u0022 by the general\npublic, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers\nBen Weider and\nJoe Weider set about broadening the appeal of\n\u0022pumping iron\u0022 and getting the sport respect, and what better poster\nboy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \u0022Austrian\nOak\u0022, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in\n1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding\nwinning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with\nit, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new\ninternational audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide\nswelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire\nflourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe.\nHowever, Schwarzenegger\u0027s horizons were bigger than just the landscape\nof bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \u0022Arnold Strong\u0022 in the low\nbudget\nHercules in New York (1970),\nthen director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in\nStay Hungry (1976) alongside\nJeff Bridges and\nSally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden\nGlobe Award for \u0022Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\u0022. The\nmesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977)\ncovering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on\nto become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus\nArnold landed other acting roles in the comedy\nThe Villain (1979) opposite\nKirk Douglas, and he portrayed\nMickey Hargitay in the well- received TV\nmovie\nThe Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a\nlavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him\nroom to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor.\nConan the Barbarian (1982)\nwas just that role. Inspired by the\nRobert E. Howard short stories of the\n\u0022Hyborean Age\u0022 and directed by gung ho director\nJohn Milius, and with a largely unknown\ncast, save Max von Sydow and\nJames Earl Jones, \u0022Conan\u0022 was a smash\nhit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled\nConan the Destroyer (1984)\nquickly followed. If \u0022Conan\u0022 was the kick start to Arnold\u0027s movie\ncareer, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and\naccelerate his star status into overdrive. Director\nJames Cameron had until that time\nonly previously directed one earlier feature film titled\nPiranha II: The Spawning (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for\nan actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator -\nThe Terminator (1984). Made on a\nrelatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction\nthriller The Terminator (1984) was\nincredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable\nfilm franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \u0022I\u0027ll be back\u0022 quickly\nbecame part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in\nvogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold\nreap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals\nwho used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done.\nThe testosterone laden Commando (1985),\nRaw Deal (1986),\nPredator (1987),\nThe Running Man (1987) and\nRed Heat (1988) were all box office hits\nand Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking\nwinning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy\nTwins (1988) with co-star\nDanny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new\nfans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once\ndescribed by Australian author / TV host\nClive James as \u0022a condom stuffed with\nwalnuts\u0022. The spectacular\nTotal Recall (1990) and \u0022feel good\u0022\nKindergarten Cop (1990) were\nboth solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to\nreturn to familiar territory with director\nJames Cameron in\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).\nThe second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget\nhad grown from the initial film\u0027s $6.5 million to an alleged $100\nmillion for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel\nbristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases \u0026amp; stunt\nsequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery.\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)\nwas arguably the zenith of Arnold\u0027s film career to date and he was\nvoted \u0022International Star of the Decade\u0022 by the National Association of\nTheatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film\nLast Action Hero (1993) brought\nArnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but\nconfusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood\naction film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in\ndroves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned\nback to good friend, director\nJames Cameron and the chemistry\nwas definitely still there as the \u0022James Bond\u0022 style spy thriller\nTrue Lies (1994) co-starring\nJamie Lee Curtis and\nTom Arnold was the surprise hit of\n1994! Following the broad audience appeal of\nTrue Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger\ndecided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with\nJunior (1994) and\nJingle All the Way (1996), but\nhe still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with\nEraser (1996), as the chilling \u0022Mr.\nFreeze\u0022 in Batman \u0026amp; Robin (1997)\nand battling dark forces in the supernatural action of\nEnd of Days (1999). The science\nfiction / conspiracy tale\nThe 6th Day (2000) played to only\nmediocre fan interest, and\nCollateral Damage (2002) had\nits theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic\nevents of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm\nreception.It was time again to resurrect Arnold\u0027s most successful franchise and,\nin 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time\nfor\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003).\nUnfortunately, directorial duties passed from\nJames Cameron to\nJonathan Mostow and the deletion of the\ncharacter of \u0022Sarah Connor\u0022 aka\nLinda Hamilton and a change in\nthe actor playing \u0022John Connor\u0022 - Nick Stahl\ntook over from Edward Furlong - making\nthe third entry in the \u0022Terminator\u0022 series the weakest to date.Schwarzenegger married TV journalist\nMaria Shriver in April, 1986 and the\ncouple have four children.In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected\nGovernor of California in a special recall election of then governor\nGray Davis. The \u0022Governator,\u0022 as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held\nthe office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor\u0027s mansion it was\nrevealed that he had fathered a child with the family\u0027s live-in maid\nand Shriver filed for divorce.Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to\nThe Rundown (2003),\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004)\nand The Kid \u0026amp; I (2005). Recently, he\nstarred in\nThe Expendables 2 (2012),\nThe Last Stand (2013),\nEscape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator Genisys (2015).",

    "Info": "Jim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is\nan actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and\nflexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to\nfame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy\nIn Living Color (1990) but\nleading roles in\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994),\nDumb and Dumber (1994) and\nThe Mask (1994) established him as a\nbankable comedy actor.James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker,\nand Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname\nwas originally \u0022Carr\u00E9\u0022, and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish\nancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child,\nhe performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed\nhis r\u00E9sum\u00E9 to\nThe Carol Burnett Show (1967)\nat age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the\nend of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates\n(provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey\u0027s early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when\nthe family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to\nScarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial\njobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after\nschool let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered).\nWhen they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a\nVolkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and\nsiblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful)\nprofessional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk\u0027s, one of the many local clubs\nthat would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He\ndropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations\n(among them Michael Landon and\nJames Stewart), and in 1979 worked\nup the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular\ngig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed\nRodney Dangerfield so much that the\nveteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During\nthis period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he\nhad a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy\ndivorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress\nLauren Holly. Wary of falling into the\nlounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance\noutlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived\nsitcom\nThe Duck Factory (1984);\nwhile the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to\npursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored\nthe male lead in the ill-received\nLauren Hutton vehicle\nOnce Bitten (1985), and had a\nsupporting role in\nPeggy Sue Got Married (1986),\nbefore making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc\nin\nEarth Girls Are Easy (1988).\nImpressed with Carrey\u0027s lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial\nDamon Wayans made a call to his brother,\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the\nprocess of putting together the sketch comedy show\nIn Living Color (1990).\nCarrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with\noutrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire\nMarshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill-\nadvised safety tips).Following his time on\nIn Living Color (1990),\nCarrey\u0027s transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened\nwithin the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn\nin\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective (1994),\na film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the\ncharacter\u0027s trademark was talking out his derri\u00E8re). Next up was the\nmanic superhero movie The Mask (1994),\nwhich had audiences wondering just how far Carrey\u0027s features could\nstretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the\nFarrelly brothers\u0027\nDumb and Dumber (1994) (his first\nmulti-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought\nhis manic antics onto the set of\nBatman Forever (1995), replacing\nRobin Williams as The Riddler. He\nalso filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough,\nAce Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995),\nand inked a deal with Sony to star in\nThe Cable Guy (1996) (replacing\nChris Farley) for a cool $20\nmillion--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been\noffered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a\ndisappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced\nback the next year with the energetic hit\nLiar Liar (1997). Worried that his\ncomic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in\nPeter Weir\u0027s\nThe Truman Show (1998) playing a\nnaive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a\nTV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took\nmoviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and\nfans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn\u0027t\nmaterialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their\nnarrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey\nthrew himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a\nhandful of other hopefuls (including\nEdward Norton) to play eccentric\nfunnyman Andy Kaufman in\nMan on the Moon (1999), Carrey\ndisappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery\nalter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman\u0027s bongo\ndrums, which he\u0027d used during his audition for director\nMilos Forman). His sometimes uncanny\nimpersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again\nthe Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly\nbrothers in\nMe, Myself \u0026amp; Irene (2000),\nplaying a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall\nin love with the same woman\n(Ren\u00E9e Zellweger). Carrey\u0027s real-life\npersona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film\nwrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then,\nCarrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy\nantihero of Ron Howard\u0027s\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films\nsuch as Bruce Almighty (2003) and\nMr. Popper\u0027s Penguins (2011),\nhe is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as\ndemonstrated in films like\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\nand the drama/comedy Yes Man (2008). In\n2013, he costars with Steve Carell in\nThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013).Carrey has one child with his first wife,\nMelissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995.\nHe married actress Lauren Holly in 1996,\nbut they split less than a year later.",

In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time.

    "Info": "Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio\u0027s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo \u002B Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n\u00E9e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \u0022Wilhelm\u0022, was his maternal grandfather\u0027s first name. Leonardo\u0027s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late \u0027Harvey Pekar\u0027, a friend of George\u0027s. Leonardo\u0027s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \u0022Lenny Williams\u0022, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn\u0027t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio\u0027s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \u0022Cousin Oliver\u0022 role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio\u0027s stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public\u0027s attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in What\u0027s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a young gunslinger in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo\u0027s reputation as an actor, it wasn\u0027t until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann\u0027s Romeo \u002B Juliet (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio\u0027s reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan\u0027s Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich\u00E9 about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.",

    "Info": "In 1976, if you had told fourteen-year-old Franciscan seminary student Thomas Cruise Mapother IV that one day in the not too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to become one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history.Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood always on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, Tom wanted to become a priest but pretty soon he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences.With handsome movie star looks and a charismatic smile, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top-grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest-paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview with the Vampire (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire (1996), for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. Tom Cruise\u0027s biggest franchise, Mission Impossible, has also earned a total of 3 billion dollars worldwide. Tom Cruise has also shown lots of interest in producing, with his biggest producer credits being the Mission Impossible franchise.In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth to become one of the biggest movie stars ever.",

    "Info": "Christopher Robert Evans is an American actor, film producer, and director. Evans began his acting career in typical fashion: performing in school productions and community theatre.He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theatre, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is former U.S. Representative Mike Capuano. Chris\u0027s father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris\u0027s mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \u0022Leontes\u0022 in \u0022The Winter\u0027s Tale\u0022 as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \u0022Guilt\u0022, Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (1999) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman\u0027s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox\u0027s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television\u0027s 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans\u0027 part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).",

    "Info": "William Bradley \u0022Brad\u0022 Pitt was born on December 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Oklahoma and raised in Springfield, Missouri to Jane Etta Pitt (n\u00E9e Hillhouse), a school counselor \u0026amp; William Alvin \u0022Bill\u0022 Pitt, a truck company manager. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for El Pollo Loco.Pitt\u0027s earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma \u0026amp; Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) \u0026amp; Cool World (1992).But Pitt\u0027s career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt\u0027s subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt\u0027s portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as an action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pe\u00F1a.Pitt and Jolie have 6 children, 3 adopted \u0026amp; 3 biological.",

    "Info": "Considered to be one of the most pivotal stars of the early days of Hollywood, Charlie Chaplin lived an interesting life both in his films and behind the camera. He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother, Syd Chaplin spent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother\u0027s bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.Chaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with Fred Karno\u0027s vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe\u0027s 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios\u0027 popular comedy director Mack Sennett, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.In November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists (UA).Chaplin\u0027s life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, at which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a \u0022paying visitor\u0022 to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin\u0027s later film The Great Dictator (1940), which was his first \u0022talkie\u0022, also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of Adolf Hitler. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.Another scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22 year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin\u0027s relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence, and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.Chaplin also was scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of Limelight (1952), he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.Chaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married Mildred Harris and they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who lived only three days. Chaplin and Harris divorced in 1920. He married Lita Grey in 1924, who had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married Paulette Goddard, and his final marriage was to Oona O\u0027Neill (Oona Chaplin), daughter of playwright Eugene O\u0027Neill in 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children: Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Chaplin, Josephine Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin, and Christopher Chaplin.In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an \u0022un-millionaire\u0022 way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his \u0022incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century\u0022. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year\u0027s Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads \u0022Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer\u0022.Chaplin\u0027s other works included musical scores that he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \u0022My Autobiography\u0022 (1964) and its companion volume, \u0022My Life in Pictures\u0022 (1974).Chaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin\u0027s corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.Six of Chaplin\u0027s films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), and The Great Dictator (1940).Charlie Chaplin is considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp\u0027s positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.",

    "Info": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother\u0027s family, originally surnamed \u0022Fraga\u0022, was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \u0022fractured\u0022 family. He moved around a great deal after his parents\u0027 divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Splash (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character\u0027s wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks\u0027 stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \u0022modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\u0022. This \u0022modern era\u0022 began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \u0022charming\u0022, and most critics agreed that Hanks\u0027 portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \u0022Above all, credit for Philadelphia\u0027s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\u0022 Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \u0022When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\u0022 Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks\u0027 next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar\u0027s computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.As of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and has remained active in the film industry for more than four decades.",

    "Info": "Sylvester Stallone is an athletically built, dark-haired American actor/screenwriter/director/producer, the movie fans worldwide have been flocking to see Stallone\u0027s films for over 40 years, making \u0022Sly\u0022 one of Hollywood\u0027s biggest-ever box office draws.Sylvester Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York\u0027s gritty\nHell\u0027s Kitchen, to Jackie Stallone (n\u00E9e\nLabofish), an astrologer, and\nFrank Stallone, a beautician\nand hairdresser. His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother\u0027s\nheritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The\nyoung Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and\nThe University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he\nstruggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core\nThe Party at Kitty and Stud\u0027s (1970),\nthe thriller Klute (1971) and the comedy\nBananas (1971). He got a crucial career\nbreak alongside fellow young actor\nHenry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the\neffectively written teen gang film\nThe Lords of Flatbush (1974).\nFurther film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring\nproductions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac,\nbloodthirsty race driver named \u0022Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\u0022 in the\nRoger Corman-produced\nDeath Race 2000 (1975). However,\nStallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an\nactor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in\nCleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given\nthe \u0022million to one opportunity\u0022 to challenge for the heavyweight\ntitle. Rocky (1976) became the stuff of\ncinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the\nBest Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially\nsuccessful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly\ndeserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from\nfellow cast members Talia Shire,\nBurgess Meredith and\nBurt Young, and director\nJohn G. Avildsen gave the film an\nemotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived\non his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure\nHollywood\u0027s hottest new star.Stallone followed Rocky (1976) with\nF.I.S.T. (1978), loosely based on the life\nof Teamsters boss \u0022Jimmy Hoffa\u0022, and\nParadise Alley (1978) before\npulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the\nsequel Rocky II (1979). The second\nouting for the \u0022Italian Stallion\u0022 wasn\u0027t as powerful or successful as\nthe first \u0022Rocky\u0022, however, it still produced strong box office.\nSubsequent films Nighthawks (1981) and\nVictory (1981) failed to ignite with\naudiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory\nwith Rocky III (1982) and a fearsome\nopponent in \u0022Clubber Lang\u0022 played by muscular ex-bodyguard\nMr. T. The third \u0022Rocky\u0022 installment far\noutperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone\nretired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another\nseries was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret \u0022John Rambo\u0022 was the creation of\nCanadian-born writer\nDavid Morrell, and his novel was\nadapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in\nFirst Blood (1982), also starring\nRichard Crenna and\nBrian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise\nhit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the\nVietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public\u0027s\npsyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and\na sequel soon followed with\nRambo: First Blood Part II (1985),\nwhich drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the\nfilm\u0027s plot line about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam.\nBut they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \u0022John\nRambo\u0027s\u0022 second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and\ncemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave\nof amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky\nBalboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a\nSoviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \u0022Ivan\nDrago\u0022 played by curt Dolph Lundgren in\nRocky IV (1985). The fourth outing was\nsomewhat controversial with \u0022Rocky\u0022 fans, as violence levels seemed\nexcessive compared to previous \u0022Rocky\u0022 films, especially with the\nsavage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by\nCarl Weathers, at the hands of the\nunstoppable \u0022Siberian Express\u0022.Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films\nthat met with a mixed reception from his fans.\nCobra (1986) was a clumsy mess,\nOver the Top (1987) was equally\nmediocre, Rambo III (1988) saw Rambo\ntake on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film\nTango \u0026amp; Cash (1989) just did not\nquite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there\nwas chemistry between Stallone and co-star\nKurt Russell.Philadelphia\u0027s favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his\nfifth screen outing in Rocky V (1990)\ntackling Tommy \u0022Machine\u0022 Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter\nTommy Morrison, the great-nephew\nof screen legend John Wayne. Sly\nquickly followed with the lukewarm comedy\nOscar (1991), the painfully unfunny\nStop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992),\nthe futuristic action film\nDemolition Man (1993), and the\ncomic book-inspired\nJudge Dredd (1995). Interestingly,\nStallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he\nhad been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more\ndramatically challenging role in the intriguing\nCop Land (1997), also starring\nRobert De Niro and\nRay Liotta. It isn\u0027t a classic of the genre,\nbut Cop Land (1997) certainly surprised\nmany critics with Stallone\u0027s understated performance. Stallone then\nlent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story\nAntz (1998), reprised the role made famous\nby Michael Caine in a terrible\nremake of Get Carter (2000), climbed\nback into a race car for Driven (2001),\nand guest-starred as the \u0022Toymaker\u0022 in the third chapter of the\nimmensely popular \u0022Spy Kids\u0022 film series,\nSpy Kids 3: Game Over (2003).\nShowing that age had not wearied his two most popular series,\nStallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky\nBalboa to star in, well, what else but\nRocky Balboa (2006), and Vietnam\nveteran Rambo (2008) will reappear after a\n20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and\nhighly respected career in Hollywood, plus, he has considerably\ninfluenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film\ncharacters.",

    "Info": "Willard Carroll \u0022Will\u0022 Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter. He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him \u0022the most powerful actor in Hollywood\u0022. Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia\u0027s Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \u0022wanted to rap.\u0022 Smith says he was admitted to a \u0022pre-engineering [summer] program\u0022 at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \u0022My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college.\u0022Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff \u0026amp; The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey \u0022DJ Jazzy Jeff\u0022 Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably \u0022Parents Just Don\u0027t Understand\u0022 and \u0022Summertime\u0022. They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming \u0022the biggest movie star in the world\u0022, studying box office successes\u0027 common characteristics.\nSmith\u0027s first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich\u0027s Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves\u0027s performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \u0022made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\u0022In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman\u0027s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be \u0022aggressively unique\u0022. A reviewer said that the film\u0027s commercial success \u0022cemented [Smith\u0027s] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood.\u0022 On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America\u0027s top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.Men in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith\u0027s most recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Focus was released on February 27, 2015. Smith was set to star in the Sci-Fic thriller Brilliance, an adaptation of Marcus Sakey\u0027s novel of the same name scripted by Jurassic Park writer David Koepp. But he left the project.Smith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute in the sports-drama Concussion, who became the first person to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a football player\u0027s brain. CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death. Smith\u0027s involvement is mostly due to his last-minute exit from the Sci-Fi thriller-drama Brilliance. Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Principal photography started on October 27, 2014. Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw played his wife.

    "Info": "Clinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (n\u00E9e Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.During the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood\u0027s big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone\u0027s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood\u0027s character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star\u0027s first U.S.-made western, Hang \u0027Em High (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan\u0027s Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly\u0027s Heroes (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the action-packed road adventures Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Every Which Way But Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.Eastwood kicked off the 1980s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \u0022Make my day.\u0022 He also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and The Rookie (1990), it seemed Eastwood\u0027s star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).Eastwood bounced back big time with his dark western Unforgiven (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received A Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while True Crime (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), which he directed but didn\u0027t appear in.Eastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood \u0026amp; Company (2012).Between acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Changeling (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), Invictus (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014\u0027s top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and The 15:17 to Paris (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in The Mule (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed Richard Jewell (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of Cry Macho (2021).Away from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.His known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho\u0027s Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.",

    "Info": "A tall, strikingly attractive blue-eyed natural blonde, Cameron Diaz was born in 1972 in San Diego, the daughter of a Cuban-American father and an Anglo-German mother. Self described as \u0022adventurous, independent and a tough kid,\u0022 Cameron left home at 16 and for the next 5 years lived in such varied locales as Japan, Australia, Mexico, Morocco, and Paris. Returning to California at the age of 21, she was working as a model when she auditioned for a big part in The Mask (1994). To her amazement and despite having no previous acting experience, she was cast as the female lead in the film opposite Jim Carrey. Over the next 3 years, she honed her acting skills in such low budget independent films as The Last Supper (1995); Feeling Minnesota (1996); and Head Above Water (1996). She returned to main stream films in My Best Friend\u0027s Wedding (1997), in which she held her own against veteran actress Julia Roberts. She earned full fledged star status in 1998 for her performance in the box office smash There\u0027s Something About Mary (1998). With her name near the top on virtually every list of Hollyood\u0027s sexiest actresses, and firmly established as one of filmdom\u0027s hottest properties and most sought after actresses, Cameron Diaz appears to possess everything necessary to become one of the super stars of the new century.",

    "Info": "George Timothy Clooney was born on May 6, 1961, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Nina Bruce (n\u00E9e Warren), a former beauty pageant queen, and Nick Clooney, a former anchorman and television host (who was also the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney). He has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Clooney spent most of his youth in Ohio and Kentucky, and graduated from Augusta High School. He was very active in sports such as basketball and baseball, and tried out for the Cincinnati Reds, but was not offered a contract.After his cousin, Miguel Ferrer, got him a small role in a feature film, Clooney began to pursue acting. His first major role was on the sitcom E/R (1984) as Ace. More roles soon followed, including George Burnett, the handsome handyman on The Facts of Life (1979); Booker Brooks, a supervisor on Roseanne (1988); and Detective James Falconer on Sisters (1991). Clooney had his breakthrough when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the award-winning drama series ER (1994), opposite Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle and Julianna Margulies.While filming \u0022ER\u0022 (1994), Clooney starred in a number of high profile film roles, such as Robert Rodriguez\u0027s From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), and One Fine Day (1996), opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1997, Clooney took on the role of Batman in Joel Schumacher\u0027s Batman \u0026amp; Robin (1997). The film was a moderate success in the box office, but was slammed by critics, notably for the nipple-laden Batsuit. Clooney went on to star in Steven Soderbergh\u0027s Out of Sight (1998), Terrence Malick\u0027s The Thin Red Line (1998), and David O. Russell\u0027s Three Kings (1999).In 1999, Clooney left \u0022ER\u0022 (1994) (though he would return for the season finale) and appeared in a number of films, including O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), The Perfect Storm (2000) and Ocean\u0027s Eleven (2001). Collaborating once again with Steven Soderbergh, Ocean\u0027s Eleven (2001) received critical acclaim, earned more than $450 million at the box office, and spawned two sequels: Ocean\u0027s Twelve (2004) and Ocean\u0027s Thirteen (2007).In 2002, Clooney made his directorial debut with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), an adaptation of TV producer Chuck Barris\u0027 autobiography. This was the first film under the banner of Section Eight Productions, a production company he founded with Steven Soderbergh. The company also produced many acclaimed films, including Far from Heaven (2002), Syriana (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006) and Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005). Clooney won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Syriana (2005), and was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005).In 2006, Section Eight Productions was shut down so that Soderbergh could concentrate on directing, and Clooney founded a new production company, Smokehouse Productions, with his friend and longtime business partner, Grant Heslov.Clooney went on to produce and star in Michael Clayton (2007) (which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor), directed and starred in Leatherheads (2008), and took leading roles in Burn After Reading (2008), The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009), Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), and Jason Reitman\u0027s Up in the Air (2009). Clooney received critical acclaim for his performance in Up in the Air (2009) and was nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award. He didn\u0027t win that year, but took home both Best Actor awards (as well as countless nominations) for his role as a father who finds out his wife was unfaithful as she lays in a coma in Alexander Payne\u0027s The Descendants (2011). Through his career, Clooney has been heralded for his political activism and humanitarian work. He has served as one of the United Nations Messengers of Peace since 2008, has been an advocate for the Darfur conflict, and organized the Hope for Haiti telethon, to raise money for the victims of the 2010 earthquake. In March 2012, Clooney was arrested for civil disobedience while protesting at the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C.Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam, from 1989 until 1993. After their divorce, he swore he would never marry again. Michelle Pfeiffer and Nicole Kidman bet him $10,000 that he would have children by the age of 40, and sent him a check shortly after his birthday. Clooney returned the funds and bet double or nothing he wouldn\u0027t have children by the age of 50. Although he has remained a consummate bachelor, Clooney has had many highly publicized relationships, including with former WWE wrestler Stacy Keibler. In 2014, he married lawyer and activist Amal Clooney, with whom he has two children, twins.",

    "Info": "One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood\u0027s best known\ndirector and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped\nout to pursue his entertainment career.\nAmong his\nearly directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World\nWar II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes\nyou believe is moving. He also directed\nEscape to Nowhere (1961), which\nfeatured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister\nAnne Spielberg, and\nThe Last Gun (1959), a western.\nAll of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg\ndirected a couple of movies that would portend his future career in\nmovies. In 1964, he directed\nFirelight (1964), a movie about aliens\ninvading a small town. In 1967, he directed\nSlipstream (1967), which was\nunfinished. However, in 1968, he directed\nAmblin\u0027 (1968), which featured the desert\nprominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would\nfeature. Amblin\u0027 also became the name of his production\ncompany, which turned out such classics as\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).\nSpielberg had a unique and classic early directing project,\nDuel (1971), with\nDennis Weaver. In the early 1970s,\nSpielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as\nRod Serling\u0027s\nNight Gallery (1969),\nMarcus Welby, M.D. (1969)\nand\nMurder by the Book (1971).\nAll of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing\nprojects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would\ndazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg\u0027s first major directorial effort was\nThe Sugarland Express (1974),\nwith Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as\na rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an\ninternational superstar among directors:\nJaws (1975). This classic shark attack tale\nstarted the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was\ncredited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977),\na unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978,\nSpielberg produced his first film, the forgettable\nI Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978),\nand followed that effort with\nUsed Cars (1980), a critically\nacclaimed, but mostly forgotten,\nKurt Russell/Jack Warden\ncomedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more\ntime with\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981),\nwith Harrison Ford taking the part\nof Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982.\nThe first was Poltergeist (1982), but\nthe highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien\nstory\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).\nSpielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The\nconcept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when\nSpielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or\ninfamous) placement of Reese\u0027s Pieces in \u0022E.T.\u0022 Spielberg was also one\nof the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \u0022E.T.\u0022\nand \u0022Close Encounters\u0022, where a very strong emphasis on special effects\nwas placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg\nfollowed up \u0022Raiders\u0022 with\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984),\nwhich was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim\nof its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in\nthe 1980s, such as\nThe Goonies (1985), and was the\nbrains behind the little monsters in\nGremlins (1984). He also produced the\ncartoon\nAn American Tail (1986), a\nquaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,\nhowever, was the blockbuster\nBack to the Future (1985),\nwhich made Michael J. Fox an\ninstant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book\nThe Color Purple (1985), with\nWhoopi Goldberg and\nOprah Winfrey, with great success. In the\nlatter half of the 1980s, he also directed\nEmpire of the Sun (1987), a\nmixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not\nescape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg\u0027s projects at the center of pop-culture\nyet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).\nThe next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he\nproduced and directed Always (1989) as\nwell as\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989),\nand\nBack to the Future Part II (1989).\nAll three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in\n1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama\nDad (1989), with\nJack Lemmon and\nTed Danson, which got mostly mixed results.\nSpielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong\nvoice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \u0022Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit\u0022, he produced the animated series\nTiny Toon Adventures (1990),\nAnimaniacs (1993),\nPinky and the Brain (1995),\nFreakazoid! (1995),\nPinky, Elmyra \u0026amp; the Brain (1998),\nFamily Dog (1993) and\nToonsylvania (1998). Spielberg\nalso produced other cartoons such as\nThe Land Before Time (1988),\nWe\u0027re Back! A Dinosaur\u0027s Story (1993),\nCasper (1995) (the live action version) as\nwell as the live-action version of\nThe Flintstones (1994), where\nhe was credited as \u0022Steven Spielrock\u0022. Spielberg also produced many\nRoger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs\nand Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s,\nas he directed Hook (1991) and produced such\nfilms as the cute fantasy\nJoe Versus the Volcano (1990)\nand\nAn American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991).\nHe also produced the unusual comedy thriller\nArachnophobia (1990),\nBack to the Future Part III (1990)\nand\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (1990).\nWhile these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not\nquite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous\nefforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed\nJurassic Park (1993), which for a\nshort time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time,\nbut did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big\nbox-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced\nand directed\nSchindler\u0027s List (1993), a\nstirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars,\nand also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the\nproduction company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many\nbox-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such\nfilms as\nThe Mask of Zorro (1998),\nMen in Black (1997) and\nDeep Impact (1998). However, it was\non the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and\nproduced the epic Amistad (1997), a\nspectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to\nthe fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997.\nThe next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best\nfilms of his career:\nSaving Private Ryan (1998), a\nfilm about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect.\nIt was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to\nShakespeare in Love (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including\nEvolution (2001),\nThe Haunting (1999) and\nShrek (2001). he also produced two sequels\nto Jurassic Park (1993), which were\nfinancially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he\nproduced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a\nfinancial and critical success:\nBand of Brothers (2001), a\ntale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the\ninvasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was\nback in the director\u0027s chair for\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001),\na movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box\noffice and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other\nthings he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series\nSeaQuest 2032 (1993), an\nanthology series entitled\nAmazing Stories (1985),\ncreated the video-game series \u0022Medal of Honor\u0022 set during World War\nTwo, and was a starting producer of\nER (1994). Spielberg, if you haven\u0027t\nnoticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and\nTom Hanks collaborated on\nShooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a\ndocumentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a\ndocumentary about the Holocaust called\nEyes of the Holocaust (2000).\nWith all of this to Spielberg\u0027s credit, it\u0027s no wonder that he\u0027s looked\nat as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.",

    "Info": "Harrison Ford was born on July 13, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois, to Dorothy (Nidelman), a radio actress, and Christopher Ford (born John William Ford), an actor turned advertising executive. His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.On March 5, 2015, Ford\u0027s plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.",

    "Info": "Alfredo James \u0022Al\u0022 \u0027Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema\u0027s most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.He was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents\u0027 home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz\u0027s \u0022The Indian Wants the Bronx\u0022, winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \u0022Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\u0022 His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\u0027Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \u0022Best Actor\u0022 Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with And Justice for All (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino\u0027s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made The Godfather Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito\u0027s Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare\u0027s Looking for Richard (1996). During this period, City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil\u0027s Advocate (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean\u0027s Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don\u0027t Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.Never wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D\u0027Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \u0022Godfather\u0022 co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Sol\u00E1, who is 36 years his junior.As of 2022, Pacino is 82-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and continues to appear regularly in film.",

    "Info": "Russell Ira Crowe was born in Wellington, New Zealand, to Jocelyn Yvonne (Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe, both of whom catered movie sets. His maternal grandfather, Stanley Wemyss, was a cinematographer. Crowe\u0027s recent ancestry includes Welsh (where his paternal grandfather was born, in Wrexham), English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, Swedish, Italian, and Maori (one of Crowe\u0027s maternal great-grandmothers, Erana Putiputi Hayes Heihi, was Maori).Crowe\u0027s family moved to Australia when he was a small child, settling in Sydney, and Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell\u0027s first big break came with two films ... the first, Romper Stomper (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, The Sum of Us (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Romper Stomper (1992) and wanted him for her film, The Quick and the Dead (1995). But filming on The Sum of Us (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With The Quick and the Dead (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuosity (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. L.A. Confidential (1997), Russell\u0027s third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn\u0027t seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mystery, Alaska (1999). He achieved even more success and awards for his performances in Gladiator (2000), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and A Beautiful Mind (2001).",

    "Info": "Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary\u0027s Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players\u0027 Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \u0022The Risen People\u0022. After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin\u0027s Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984),\nThe Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen\u0027s Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler\u0027s List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \u0022Anna Christie\u0022, in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood\u0027s top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan\u0027s\nBatman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Wrath of the Titans (2012).Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the\n1999 Queen\u0027s New Year\u0027s Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).",

    "Info": "Ask Kate Winslet what she likes about any of her characters, and the word \u0022ballsy\u0022 is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she\u0027s built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London\u0027s West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids\u0027 cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Heavenly Creatures (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee\u0027s Sense and Sensibility (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film\u0027s star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh\u0027s Hamlet (1996).The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron\u0027s Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet\u0027s performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \u0022deprogramming\u0022 session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade\u0027s chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard.For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination.Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss.In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List for her services to Drama.",

    "Info": "American actor Mark Wahlberg is one of a handful of respected entertainers who successfully made the transition from teen pop idol to acclaimed actor. A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for The Departed (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in The Fighter (2010), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in Ted (2012).Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse\u0027s aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn\u0027t have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark\u0027s mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son\u0027s subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He\u0027d spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \u0022Funky Bunch\u0022 and \u0022Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\u0022 was born. His debut album, \u0022Music for the People\u0022, was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper\u0027s willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \u0022bad boy\u0022. Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein, Marky Mark was set up as the designer\u0027s chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the New Kids on the Block\u0027s fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \u0022Marky Mark\u0027s\u0022 bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \u0022You Gotta Believe\u0022, had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \u0022Marky Mark\u0022 moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall\u0027s Renaissance Man (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In Renaissance Man (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial The Basketball Diaries (1995) and chilled them in Fear (1996) as every father\u0027s worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg\u0027s career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson\u0027s Boogie Nights (1997). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Three Kings (1999) and The Perfect Storm (2000), popcorn flicks like Planet of the Apes (2001) and Contraband (2012), and even indies such as I Heart Huckabees (2004).Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire (2010), In Treatment (2008) and the highly successful comedy Entourage (2004), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.",

    "Info": "The tall, handsome and muscular Scottish actor Sean Connery is best known as the original actor to portray James Bond in the hugely successful movie franchise, starring in seven films between 1962 and 1983. Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in The Untouchables (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie\u0027s principal star Kevin Costner. Connery was polled as \u0022The Greatest Living Scot\u0022 and \u0022Scotland\u0027s Greatest Living National Treasure.\u0022 In 1989, he was proclaimed \u0022Sexiest Man Alive\u0022 by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was proclaimed \u0022Sexiest Man of the Century.\u0022Thomas \u0022Sean\u0022 Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. His mother, Euphemia Maclean, was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He also had a brother, Neil Connery, a plasterer in Edinburgh, who was eight years younger. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist\u0027s model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional soccer player or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent decisions.No Road Back (1957) was Sean\u0027s first major movie role, and it was followed by several made-for-TV movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) as well as guest appearances on TV series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O\u0027Gill and the Little People (1959) and The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars.His big breakthrough came in 1962 when he landed the role of secret agent James Bond in Dr. No (1962). He played James Bond in six more films: From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983).After and during the success of the Bond films, he maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003).Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had Sean\u0027s only child, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963. The couple announced their separation in February 1971 and filed for divorce 2\u00BD years later. Sean then dated Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Magda Konopka and Carole Mallory.

    "Info": "Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \u0022cool breeze over the mountains\u0022 in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patric Reeves, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\u0027s father was born in Hawaii, of Native Hawaiian and Chinese ancestry while Keanu\u0027s mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents\u0027 marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \u0022The Wall\u0022) and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\u0027 radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River\u0027s Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Dangerous Liaisons (1988) with director Stephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \u0022Theodore\u0022 Logan in Bill \u0026amp; Ted\u0027s Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\u0027s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard\u0027s comedy, Parenthood (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan\u0027s I Love You to Death (1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix\u0027s narcoleptic male hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire\u0027s lair in Dracula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil\u0027s Advocate (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too:\nJohnny Mnemonic (1995) and Chain Reaction (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\u0027 cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them The Replacements (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift (2000), Sweet November (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Something\u0027s Gotta Give (2003), The Lake House (2006), and Street Kings (2008). He\u0027s kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). And he\u0027s waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), and Henry\u0027s Crime (2010).Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.",

    "Info": "Hong Kong\u0027s cheeky, lovable and best-known film star, Jackie Chan endured many years of long, hard work and multiple injuries to establish international success after his start in Hong Kong\u0027s manic martial arts cinema industry.Jackie was born Kong-sang Chan on April 7, 1954, on Hong Kong\u0027s famous Victoria Peak, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, and the family immigrated to Canberra, Australia, in early 1960. The young Jackie was less than successful scholastically, so his father sent him back to Hong Kong to attend the rigorous China Drama Academy, one of the Peking Opera schools. Chan excelled at acrobatics, singing and martial arts and eventually became a member of the \u0022Seven Little Fortunes\u0022 performing troupe and began lifelong friendships with fellow martial artists / actors Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and Biao Yuen. Chan journeyed back and forth to visit his parents and work in Canberra, but eventually he made his way back to Hong Kong as his permanent home. In the early 1970s, Chan commenced his movie career and interestingly appeared in very minor roles in two films starring then rising martial arts superstar Bruce Lee: Fist of Fury (1972) (aka \u0022The Chinese Connection\u0022), and the Warner Bros. production Enter the Dragon (1973). Not long after Lee\u0027s untimely death, Chan was often cast in films cashing in on the success of Bruce Lee by utilizing words like \u0022fist\u0022, \u0022fury\u0022 or \u0022dragon\u0022 in their US release titles.Chan\u0027s own film career was off and running and he swiftly appeared in many low-budget martial arts films that were churned out at a rapid-fire pace by Hong Kong studios eager to satisfy the early 1970s boom in martial-arts cinema. He starred in Shaolin Wooden Men (1976), To Kill with Intrigue (1977), Half a Loaf of Kung Fu (1978) and Magnificent Bodyguards (1978), which all fared reasonably well at the cinemas. However, he scored a major breakthrough with the action comedy Drunken Master (1978), which has become a cult favorite among martial arts film fans. Not too long after this, Chan made his directorial debut with The Young Master (1980) and then \u0022Enter the Dragon\u0022 producer Robert Clouse lured Jackie to the United States for a film planned to break Jackie into the lucrative US market. Battle Creek Brawl (1980) featured Jackie competing in a \u0022toughest Street fighter\u0022 contest set in 1940s Texas; however, Jackie was unhappy with the end result, and it failed to fire with US audiences. In a further attempt to get his name known in the United States, Jackie was cast alongside Burt Reynolds, Sir Roger Moore and Dean Martin in the Hal Needham-directed car chase film The Cannonball Run (1981). Regrettably, Jackie was cast as a Japanese race driver and his martial arts skills are only shown in one small sequence near the film\u0027s conclusion. Stateside success was still a few years away for Jackie Chan!Undeterred, he returned to East Asia to do what he did best--make jaw-dropping action films loaded with amazing stunt work. Chan and his legendary stunt team were without parallel in their ability to execute the most incredible fight scenes and action sequences, and the next decade would see some of their best work. Chan paired with the dynamic Sammo Kam-Bo Hung to star in Winners \u0026amp; Sinners (1983), Project A (1983), Wheels on Meals (1984), My Lucky Stars (1985) (aka \u0022Winners \u0026amp; Sinners 2\u0022), Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars (1985) (aka \u0022Winners \u0026amp; Sinners 3\u0022). Chan then journeyed back to the United States for another shot at that market, starring alongside Danny Aiello in The Protector (1985), filmed in Hong Kong and New York. However, as with previous attempts, Jackie felt the US director--in this case, James Glickenhaus--failed to understand his audience appeal and the film played to lukewarm reviews and box-office receipts. However, Jackie did decide to \u0022harden\u0022 up his on-screen image somewhat and his next film, Police Story (1985) was a definite departure from previously light-hearted martial arts fare, and his fans loved the final product!This was quickly followed up with the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)-influenced Armour of God (1986), during filming of which Jackie mistimed a leap from a wall to a tree on location in Yugoslavia and fell many quite a few feet onto his head, causing a skull fracture. It was another in a long line of injuries that Chan has suffered as a result of doing his own stunt work, and he was soon back in front of the cameras. Project A 2 (1987), Police Story 2 (1988), Miracles: The Canton Godfather (1989) (aka \u0022Mr. Canton and Lady Rose)\u0022, Armour of God 2: Operation Condor (1991) (aka \u0022Armour of God 2\u0022) and Supercop (1992) (aka \u0022Police Story 3\u0022) were all sizable hits for Jackie, escalating his status to phenomenal heights in Asia, and to his loyal fanbase around the globe. US success was now just around the corner for the hard-working Jackie Chan, and it arrived in the form of the action film Rumble in the Bronx (1995) (though it was actually filmed in Canada) that successfully blended humor and action to make a winning formula in US theaters.Jackie did not waste any time and went to work on First Strike (1996) (aka \u0022Police Story 4\u0022), Mr. Nice Guy (1997), Who Am I? (1998), which all met with positive results at the international box office. Jackie then went to work in his biggest-budget US production, starring alongside fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker in the action comedy Rush Hour (1998). The film was a bigger hit than \u0022Rumble in the Bronx\u0022 and firmly established Jackie as a bona fide star in the United States. Jackie then paired up with rising talent Owen Wilson to star in Shanghai Noon (2000) and its sequel, Shanghai Knights (2003), and re-teamed with Tucker in Rush Hour 2 (2001), as well as starring in The Tuxedo (2002), The Medallion (2003) and the delightful Around the World in 80 Days (2004). Not one to forget his loyal fanbase, Jackie returned to more gritty and traditional fare with New Police Story (2004) and The Myth (2005). The multi-talented Chan (he is also a major recording star in Asia) shows no sign of slowing down and has long since moved out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, to whom he was usually compared early in his career.Chan is truly one of the international film industry\u0027s true maverick actor / director / stuntman / producer combinations - he has done this the hard way, and always his way to achieve his dreams and goals to be an international cinematic star. Off screen, he has been directly involved in many philanthropic ventures providing financial assistance to schools and universities around the world. He is a UNICEF GoodWill Ambassador, and he has campaigned against animal abuse and pollution and assisted with disaster relief efforts to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami victims.",

    "Info": "Angelina Jolie is an Academy Award-winning actress who rose to fame after her role in Girl, Interrupted (1999), playing the title role in the \u0022Lara Croft\u0022 blockbuster movies, as well as Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), Salt (2010) and Maleficent (2014). Off-screen, Jolie has become prominently involved in international charity projects, especially those involving refugees. She often appears on many \u0022most beautiful women\u0022 lists, and she has a personal life that is avidly covered by the tabloid press.Jolie was born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California. In her earliest years, Angelina began absorbing the acting craft from her actor parents, Jon Voight, an Oscar-winner, and Marcheline Bertrand, who had studied with Lee Strasberg. Her good looks may derive from her ancestry, which is German and Slovak on her father\u0027s side, and French-Canadian, Dutch, Polish, and remote Huron, on her mother\u0027s side. At age eleven, Angelina began studying at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she was seen in several stage productions. She undertook some film studies at New York University and later joined the renowned Met Theatre Group in Los Angeles. At age 16, she took up a career in modeling and appeared in some music videos.In the mid-1990s, Jolie appeared in various small films where she got good notices, including Hackers (1995) and Foxfire (1996). Her critical acclaim increased when she played strong roles in the made-for-TV movies True Women (1997), and in George Wallace (1997) which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Jolie\u0027s acclaim increased even further when she played the lead role in the HBO production Gia (1998). This was the true life story of supermodel Gia Carangi, a sensitive wild child who was both brazen and needy and who had a difficult time handling professional success and the deaths of people who were close to her. Carangi became involved with drugs and because of her needle-using habits she became, at the tender age of 26, one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS. Jolie\u0027s performance in Gia (1998) again garnered a Golden Globe Award and another Emmy nomination, and she additionally earned a SAG Award.Angelina got a major break in 1999 when she won a leading role in the successful feature The Bone Collector (1999), starring alongside Denzel Washington. In that same year, Jolie gave a tour de force performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999) playing opposite Winona Ryder. The movie was a true story of women who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. Jolie\u0027s role was reminiscent of Jack Nicholson\u0027s character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest (1975), the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike \u0022Cuckoo,\u0022 \u0022Girl\u0022 was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- \u0022Girl\u0022 propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role.With her newfound prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her Hackers (1995) co-star Jonny Lee Miller, she had displayed her husband\u0027s name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her Pushing Tin (1999) co-star Billy Bob Thornton. Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other\u0027s blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father, Jon Voight.In 2000, Jolie was asked to star in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The eponymous character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the movie was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn\u0027t the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie\u0027s father Jon Voight appeared in the movie, and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter.One of the Lara Croft movie\u0027s filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book \u0022Notes from My Travels\u0022 whose profits go to UNHCR.Jolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie\u0027s dramatic feature film Beyond Borders (2003) parallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie\u0027s images were too depressingly realistic -- the movie was not popular among critics or at the box office.In 2004, Jolie began filming Mr. \u0026amp; Mrs. Smith (2005) with co-star Brad Pitt. The movie became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife Jennifer Aniston in January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt\u0027s divorce was finalized later in 2005.Jolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple, who married in 2014 and divorced in 2019, continue to pursue movie and humanitarian projects, and now have a total of six children. She was appointed Honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George at the 2014 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours for her services to United Kingdom foreign policy and the campaign to end warzone sexual violence.",

    "Info": "When hunky, twenty-year-old heart-throb Heath Ledger first came to the attention of the public in 1999, it was all too easy to tag him as a \u0022pretty boy\u0022 and an actor of little depth. He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight\u0027s Tale (2001), Monster\u0027s Ball (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), I\u0027m Not There (2007), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive clich\u00E9; an adolescent angst film about one boy\u0027s struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri\u0027s brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \u0022Oberon\u0022. A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster\u0027s Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I\u0027m Not There (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan\u0027s life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in \u0027The Dark Knight (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.",

The two-week job stretched to two months, and Jessica ended the film with an impressive first credit. Two national TV commercials for Nintendo and J.C.

Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickelodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close\u0027s Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS\u0027s update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting.One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds\u0027 jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott.

His father, Edward Mower Norton, was an environmental lawyer and conservationist, who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Edward has two younger siblings, James and Molly.From the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee\u0027s Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen\u0027s Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996).

This was followed by small parts in the British crime series The Bill (1984), an exiled German princess in The Treasure Seekers (1996) and a much more substantial role as the young \u0022Judith Dunbar\u0022 in Giles Foster\u0027s adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher\u0027s novel Coming Home (1998), alongside Peter O\u0027Toole, Penelope Keith and Joanna Lumley. The first time Keira\u0027s name was mentioned around the world was when it was revealed (in a plot twist kept secret by director George Lucas) that she played Natalie Portman\u0027s decoy \u0022Padme\u0022 to Portman\u0027s \u0022Amidala\u0022 in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). It was several years before agreement was reached over which scenes featured Keira as the queen and which featured Natalie!Keira had no formal training as an actress and did it out of pure enjoyment. She went to an ordinary council-run school in nearby Teddington and had no idea what she wanted to do when she left. By now, she was beginning to receive far more substantial roles and was starting to turn work down as one project and her schoolwork was enough to contend with. She reappeared on British television in 1999 as \u0022Rose Fleming\u0022 in Alan Bleasdale\u0027s faithful reworking of Charles Dickens\u0027 Oliver Twist (1999), and traveled to Romania to film her first title role in Walt Disney\u0027s Princess of Thieves (2001) in which she played Robin Hood\u0027s daughter, Gwyn. Keira\u0027s first serious boyfriend was her Princess of Thieves (2001) co-star Del Synnott, and they later co-starred in Peter Hewitt\u0027s \u0027work of fart\u0027 Thunderpants (2002). Nick Hamm\u0027s dark thriller The Hole (2001) kept her busy during 2000, and featured her first nude scene (15 at the time, the film was not released until she was 16 years old). In the summer of 2001, while Keira studied and sat her final school exams (she received six A\u0027s), she filmed a movie about an Asian girl\u0027s (Parminder Nagra) love for football and the prejudices she has to overcome regarding both her culture and her religion). Bend It Like Beckham (2002) was a smash hit in football-mad Britain but it had to wait until another of Keira\u0027s films propelled it to the top end of the US box office. Bend It Like Beckham (2002) cost just \u00A33.5m to make, and nearly \u00A31m of that came from the British Lottery. It took \u00A311m in the UK and has since gone on to score more than US$76m worldwide.Meanwhile, Keira had started A-levels at Esher College, studying Classics, English Literature and Political History, but continued to take acting roles which she thought would widen her experience as an actress. The story of a drug-addicted waitress and her friendship with the young son of a drug-addict, Pure (2002), occupied Keira from January to March 2002. Also at this time, Keira\u0027s first attempt at Shakespeare was filmed. She played \u0022Helena\u0022 in a modern interpretation of a scene from \u0022A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream\u0022 entitled The Seasons Alter (2002). This was commissioned by the environmental organization \u0022Futerra\u0022, of which Keira\u0027s mother is patron. Keira received no fee for this performance or for another short film, New Year\u0027s Eve (2002), by award-winning director Col Spector. But it was a chance encounter with producer Andy Harries at the London premiere of Bridget Jones\u0027s Diary (2001) which forced Keira to leave her studies and pursue acting full-time. The meeting lead to an audition for the role of \u0022Larisa Feodorovna Guishar\u0022 - the classic heroine of Boris Pasternak\u0027s novel Doctor Zhivago (2002), played famously in the David Lean movie by Julie Christie. This was to be a big-budget TV movie with a screenplay written by Andrew Davies. Keira won the part and the mini-series was filmed throughout the Spring of 2002 in Slovakia, co-starring Sam Neill and Hans Matheson as \u0022Yuri Zhivago\u0022. Keira rounded off 2002 with a few scenes in the first movie to be directed by Blackadder and Vicar of Dibley writer Richard Curtis. Called Love Actually (2003), Keira played \u0022Juliet\u0022, a newlywed whose husband\u0027s Best Man is secretly besotted with her. A movie filmed after Love Actually (2003) but released before it was to make the world sit up and take notice of this beautiful fresh-faced young actress with a cute British accent. It was a movie which Keira very nearly missed out on, altogether. Auditions were held in London for a new blockbuster movie called Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), but heavy traffic in the city forced Keira to be tagged on to the end of the day\u0027s auditions list. It helped - she got the part. Filming took place in Los Angeles and the Caribbean from October 2002 to March 2003 and was released to massive box office success and almost universal acclaim in the July of that year.Meanwhile, a small British film called Bend It Like Beckham (2002) had sneaked onto a North American release slate and was hardly setting the box office alight. But Keira\u0027s dominance in \u0022Pirates\u0022 had set tongues wagging and questions being asked about the actress playing \u0022Elizabeth Swann\u0022. Almost too late, \u0022Bend It\u0022\u0027s distributors realized one of its two stars was the same girl whose name was on everyone\u0027s lips due to \u0022Pirates\u0022, and took the unusual step of re-releasing \u0022Bend It\u0022 to 1,000 screens across the US, catapulting it from no. 26 back up to no. 12. \u0022Pirates\u0022, meanwhile, was fighting off all contenders at the top spot, and stayed in the Top 3 for an incredible 21 weeks. It was perhaps no surprise, then, that Keira was on producer Jerry Bruckheimer\u0027s wanted list for the part of \u0022Guinevere\u0022 in a planned accurate telling of the legend of \u0022King Arthur\u0022. Filming took place in Ireland and Wales from June to November 2003. In July, Keira had become the celebrity face of British jeweller and luxury goods retailer, Asprey. At a photoshoot for the company on Long Island New York in August, Keira met and fell in love with Northern Irish model Jamie Dornan. King Arthur (2004) was released in July 2004 to lukewarm reviews. It seems audiences wanted the legend after all, and not necessarily the truth. Keira became the breakout star and \u0027one to watch in 2004\u0027 throughout the world\u0027s media at the end of 2003.Keira\u0027s 2004 started off in Scotland and Canada filming John Maybury\u0027s time-travelling thriller The Jacket (2005) with Oscar-winner Adrien Brody. A planned movie of Deborah Moggach\u0027s novel, \u0022Tulip Fever\u0022, about forbidden love in 17th Century Amsterdam, was canceled in February after the British government suddenly closed tax loopholes which allowed filmmakers to claw back a large proportion of their expenditure. Due to star Keira and Jude Law in the main roles, the film remains mothballed. Instead, Keira spent her time wisely, visiting Ethiopia on behalf of the \u0022Comic Relief\u0022 charity, and spending summer at various grandiose locations around the UK filming what promises to be a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen\u0027s classic novel Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice (2005), alongside Matthew Macfadyen as \u0022Mr. Darcy\u0022, and with Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench in supporting roles. In October 2004, Keira received her first major accolade, the Hollywood Film Award for Best Breakthrough Actor - Female, and readers of Empire Magazine voted her the Sexiet Movie Star Ever. The remainder of 2004 saw Keira once again trying a completely new genre, this time the part-fact, part-fiction life story of model turned bounty hunter Domino (2005).\n2005 started with the premiere of The Jacket (2005) at the Sundance Film Festival, with the US premiere in LA on February 28th. Much of the year was then spent in the Caribbean filming both sequels to Pirates Of The Caribbean. Keira\u0027s first major presenting role came in a late-night bed-in comedy clip show for Comic Relief with presenter Johnny Vaughan. In late July, promotions started for the September release of Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice (2005), with British fans annoyed to learn that the US version would end with a post-marriage kiss, but the European version would not. Nevertheless, when the movie opened in September on both sides of the Atlantic, Keira received her greatest praise thus far in her career, amid much talk of awards. It spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK box office.Domino (2005) opened well in October, overshadowed by the death of Domino Harvey earlier in the year. Keira received Variety\u0027s Personality Of The Year Award in November, topped the following month by her first Golden Globe nomination, for Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice (2005). KeiraWeb.com exclusively announced that Keira would play Helene Joncour in an adaptation of Alessandro Baricco\u0027s novella Silk (2007). Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice (2005) garnered six BAFTA nominations at the start of 2006, but not Best Actress for Keira, a fact which paled soon after by the announcement she had received her first Academy Award nomination, the third youngest Best Actress Oscar hopeful. A controversial nude Vanity Fair cover of Keira and Scarlett Johansson kept the press busy up till the Oscars, with Reese Witherspoon taking home the gold man in the Best Actress category, although Keira\u0027s Vera Wang dress got more media attention. Keira spent early summer in Europe filming Silk (2007) opposite Michael Pitt, and the rest of the summer in the UK filming Atonement (2007), in which she plays Cecilia Tallis, and promoting the new Pirates movie (her Ellen Degeneres interview became one of the year\u0027s Top 10 \u0027viral downloads\u0027). Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man\u0027s Chest (2006) broke many box office records when it opens worldwide in July, becoming the third biggest movie ever by early September. Keira sued British newspaper The Daily Mail in early 2007 after her image in a bikini accompanied an article about a woman who blamed slim celebrities for the death of her daughter from anorexia. The case was settled and Keira matched the settlement damages and donated the total amount to an eating disorder charity. Keira filmed a movie about the life of Dylan Thomas, The Edge Of Love (2008) with a screenplay written by her mother Sharman Macdonald. Her co-star Lindsay Lohan pulled out just a week before filming began, and was replaced by Sienna Miller.What was announced to be Keira\u0027s final Pirates movie in the franchise, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\u0027s End (2007), opened strongly in June, rising to all-time fifth biggest movie by July. Atonement (2007) opened the Venice Film Festival in August, and opened worldwide in September, again to superb reviews for Keira. Meanwhile, Silk (2007) opened in September on very few screens and disappeared without a trace. Keira spent the rest of the year filming The Duchess (2008), the life story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, based on Amanda Foreman\u0027s award-winning biography of the distant relation of Princess Diana. The year saw more accolades and poll-topping for Keira than ever before, including Women\u0027s Beauty Icon 2007 and gracing the covers of all the top-selling magazines. She won Best Actress for Atonement (2007) at the Variety Club Of Great Britain Showbiz Awards, and ended the year with her second Golden Globe nomination. Christmas Day saw - or rather heard - Keira on British TV screens in a new Robbie The Reindeer animated adventure, with DVD proceeds going to Comic Relief. At the start of 2008, Keira received her first BAFTA nomination - Best Actress for Atonement, and the movie wins Best Film: Drama at the Golden Globes. Seven Academy Award nominations for Atonement soon follow. Keira wins Best Actress for her role as Cecilia Tallis at the Empire Film Awards. In May, Keira\u0027s first Shakespearean role is announced, when she is confirmed to play Cordelia in a big-screen version of King Lear, alongside Naomi Watts and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Sir Anthony Hopkins as the titular monarch. After two years of rumours, it is confirmed that Keira is on the shortlist to play Eliza Doolittle in a new adaptation of My Fair Lady. The Edge Of Love opens the Edinburgh Film Festival on June 18th, and opens on limited release in the UK and US. A huge round of promotions for The Duchess occurs throughout the summer, with cast and crew trying to play down the marketers\u0027 decision to draw parallels between the duchess and Princess Diana. Keira attends the UK and US premieres and Toronto Film Festival within the first week of September. The Duchess opens strongly on both sides of the Atlantic. Two more movies were confirmed for Keira during September - a tale of adultery called Last Night (2010), and a biopic of author F Scott Fitzgerald entitled The Beautiful and the Damned.Keira spent October on the streets of New York City filming Last Night alongside Sam Worthington and Guillaume Canet. Keira helped to promote the sixtieth anniversary of the UN\u0027s Declaration of Human Rights, by contributing to a series of short films produced to mark the occasion. In January 2009 it was announced Keira had signed to play a reclusive actress in an adaptation of Ken Bruen\u0027s novel London Boulevard (2010), co-starring Colin Farrell. Keira continues her close ties with the Comic Relief charity by helping to launch their British icons T-shirts campaign. In the same week King Lear was revealed to have been shelved, it was announced that Keira would instead star alongside her Pride \u0026amp; Prejudice co-star Carey Mulligan in an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro\u0027s novel Never Let Me Go (2010). A new short film emerges in March, recorded in the January of 2008 in which Keira plays a Fairy! The Continuing and Lamentable Saga of the Suicide Brothers (2009) was written by Keira\u0027s boyfriend Rupert Friend and actor Tom Mison. It went to be shown at the London Film Festival in October and won Best Comedy Short at the New Hampshire Film Festival. Keira continued to put her celebrity to good use in 2009 with a TV commercial for WomensAid highlighting domestic abuse against women. Unfortunately, UK censors refused to allow its broadcast and it can only be viewed on YouTube. May and June saw Keira filming Never Let Me Go (2010) and London Boulevard (2010) back-to-back. In October, a new direction for Keira\u0027s career emerged, when it was announced she would appear on the London stage in her West End debut role as Jennifer, in a reworking of Moliere\u0027s The Misanthrope, starring Damian Lewis and Tara Fitzgerald. More than $2m of ticket sales followed in the first four days, before even rehearsals had begun! The play ran from December to March at London\u0027s Comedy Theatre.",

    "Info": "Bradley Charles Cooper was born on January 5, 1975 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother, Gloria (Campano), is of Italian descent, and worked for a local NBC station. His father, Charles John Cooper, who was of Irish descent, was a stockbroker. Immediately after Bradley graduated from the Honors English program at Georgetown University in 1997, he moved to New York City to enroll in the Masters of Fine Arts program at the Actors Studio Drama School at New School University. There, he developed his stage work, culminating with his thesis performance as John Merrick in Bernard Pomerance\u0027s \u0022The Elephant Man\u0022, performed in New York\u0027s Circle in the Square.While still in school, Bradley began his professional career, appearing opposite Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex and the City (1998) and on the drama series The Beat (2000). His weekends were spent with LEAP (Learning through the Expanded Arts Program), a non-profit organization that teaches acting and movement to inner city school children. The summers took him all across the globe, from kayaking in British Columbia with Orca Whales to ice-climbing in the Peruvian Andes, while hosting Lonely Planet\u0027s Treks in a Wild World (2000) for the Discovery Channel. Bradley had to miss his graduation ceremony from the Actors Studio in order to star in his first feature Wet Hot American Summer (2001). After finishing his second feature Bending All the Rules (2002), his plans to relocate to Los Angeles were delayed when Darren Star hired him to star on the drama series The $treet (2000).Bradley went on to win the role of young law student Gordon Pinella in Changing Lanes (2002), starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, and also played Travis Paterson in My Little Eye (2002). He finally decided that it was time to forgo his other New York projects and move to Los Angeles when he was cast on Alias (2001). After supporting roles in Wedding Crashers (2005), Failure to Launch (2006), The Comebacks (2007), The Rocker (2008) and Yes Man (2008), Cooper broke out with major roles in He\u0027s Just Not That Into You (2009), The Hangover (2009) and Valentine\u0027s Day (2010).

Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s.Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) - most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career, but a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis\u0027s Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the romantic lead in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career.His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor\u0027s remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984).In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman.

    "Info": "One of the British theatre\u0027s most famous faces, Daniel Craig, who waited tables as a struggling teenage actor with the National Youth Theatre, has gone on to star as James Bond in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021).He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \u0022Ring O\u0027Bells\u0022 pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig has English, as well as Irish, Scottish and Welsh, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of six, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \u0022Oliver!\u0022, and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore\u0027s Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \u0022Oliver\u0022, \u0022Romeo and Juliet\u0022 and \u0022Cinderella\u0022 at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre\u0027s (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare\u0027s \u0022Troilus and Cressida\u0022. As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in The Power of One (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig\u0027s reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.He was appointed Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) by Queen Elizabeth II at the 2022 Queen\u0027s New Years Honours for his services to Film and Theatre.",

    "Info": "Widely regarded as one of the greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, twice nominated for the Oscar and recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK and US, Ian Murray McKellen was born on May 25, 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, England, to Margery Lois (Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer and lay preacher. He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his older sister, Jean, to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theatre, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian\u0027s growing passion for theatre.When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \u0022Twelfth Night\u0022. Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theatre festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian\u0027s homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher\u0027s \u0022Section 28\u0022 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theatre, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare\u0027s works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Apt Pupil (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen\u0027s role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps in \u0027solidifying\u0027 his \u0027role\u0027 as Laurence Olivier\u0027s worthy \u0027successor\u0027 in the best sense too, such as King Lear (2008) / King Lear (2008) directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \u0022Peter Pan\u0022 and No\u00EBl Coward\u0027s \u0022Present Laughter\u0022, as well as Samuel Beckett\u0027s \u0022Waiting for Godot\u0022 and Harold Pinter\u0027s \u0022No Man\u0027s Land\u0022 (National Theatre Live: No Man\u0027s Land (2016)), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias.McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \u0022The Lord of the Rings\u0022 film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in \u0022The Hobbit\u0022 trilogy. He also reprised the role of \u0027King Lear\u0027 with new artistic perspectives in National Theatre Live: King Lear (2018) offering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king.",

Her father was African-American and her mother is of mostly English and German descent. Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and, a year later in 1986, when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant, Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series, 1989\u0027s Living Dolls (1989), where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity, preferring to \u0022live\u0022 her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee\u0027s Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough. The following year, she was cast as Eddie Murphy\u0027s love interest in Boomerang (1992), one of the few times that Murphy was evenly matched on screen. In 1994, Berry gained a youthful following for her performance as sexy secretary \u0022Sharon Stone\u0022 in The Flintstones (1994). She next had a highly publicized starring role with Jessica Lange in the adoption drama Losing Isaiah (1995). Though the movie received mixed reviews, Berry didn\u0027t let that slow her down, and continued down her path to super-stardom.In 1998, she received critical success when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up with a struggling politician in Warren Beatty\u0027s Bulworth (1998). The following year, she won even greater acclaim for her role as actress Dorothy Dandridge in made-for-cable\u0027s Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Movie/Mini-Series. In 2000, she received box office success in X-Men (2000) in which she played \u0022Storm\u0022, a mutant who has the ability to control the weather. In 2001, she starred in the thriller Swordfish (2001), and became the first African-American to win Best Actress at the Academy Awards, for her role as a grieving mother in the drama Monster\u0027s Ball (2001).",

    "Info": "Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD.Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene Kassel, and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \u0022discovered\u0022 whilst working in a caf\u00E9 in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \u0022David Addison\u0022 alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \u0022John McClane\u0022 in the monster hit Die Hard (1988), in which Willis\u0027 character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel, Die Hard 2 (1990), set at a snowbound Washington\u0027s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), this time co-starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice\nof \u0022Mikey\u0022 the baby in the very popular family comedies Look Who\u0027s Talking (1989), and its sequel Look Who\u0027s Talking Too (1990) also starring John Travolta and\nKirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyper-violent\nThe Last Boy Scout (1991), the darkly humored Death Becomes Her (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Striking Distance (1993).During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing North (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in\nthe Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction (1994), the\nTerry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller 12 Monkeys (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus The Fifth Element (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic The Sixth Sense (1999).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000),\nworked again with \u0022hot\u0022 director M. Night Shyamalan in the less than\ngripping Unbreakable (2000), and in two military dramas, Hart\u0027s War (2002)\nand Tears of the Sun (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically\napplauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City (2005), the voice of \u0022RJ\u0022 the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Over the Hedge (2006) and \u0022Die Hard\u0022 fans rejoiced to see \u0022John McClane\u0022 return to the big screen in\nthe high tech Live Free or Die Hard (2007) aka \u0022Die Hard 4.0\u0022.Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.",

He achieved prominence and critical acclaim in the early 1990s with films such as Patriot Games (1992), Amos \u0026amp; Andrew (1993), True Romance (1993), Jurassic Park (1993), and his collaborations with director Quentin Tarantino, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), and later Django Unchained (2012). Going from supporting player to leading man, his performance in Pulp Fiction (1994) gave him an Oscar nomination for his character Jules Winnfield, and he received a Silver Berlin Bear for his part as Ordell Robbi in Jackie Brown (1997). Jackson usually played bad guys and drug addicts before becoming an action hero, co-starring with Bruce Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) and Geena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996).With Jackson\u0027s permission, his likeness was used for the Ultimate version of the Marvel Comics character, Nick Fury.

    "Info": "Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller was born on November 30, 1965, in New York City, New York, to legendary comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His father was of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish Catholic descent (she\nconverted to Judaism).His parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering\njust why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister Amy Stiller would perform plays at home, wearing Amy\u0027s tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward Stiller ... and then he would\nalways get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus\nReality Bites (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which co-starred Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke.Before he got to Hollywood, he put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, \u0022The House of Blue Leaves\u0022. While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of The Color of Money (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his The House of Blue Leaves (1987) costar John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it on Saturday Night Live (1975). This led to his spending a year on the show in 1989.Stiller made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg\u0027s Empire of the Sun (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show, The Ben Stiller Show (1992). He recruited fellow offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly\nsatirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out\nof work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation.For a while, Stiller had to settle for guest appearance work. While doing this, he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape\nenough together to make Reality Bites (1994), now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted.\nBen continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey\u0027s The Cable Guy (1996). Although many\ncritics were impressed, Jim Carrey\u0027s fans were not. In 1998, There\u0027s Something About Mary (1998) had propelled Stiller into the mainstream spotlight. He also starred in such hit movies as Keeping the Faith (2000) and Meet the Parents (2000).",

He was arrested by the Spanish police for performance in a play by Bertolt Brecht, because of political censorship under the rule of General Francisco Franco. Banderas spent a whole night at the police station, he had three or four such arrests while he was working with a small theatre troupe that toured all over Spain and was giving performances in small town theatres and on the street.In 1979, at age 19, he moved to Madrid in pursuit of an acting career. Being a struggling young actor, he also worked as a waiter and took small modeling jobs. At that time, he joined the troupe at the National Theatre of Spain, becoming the youngest member of the company. Banderas\u0027 stage performances caught the attention of movie director Pedro Almod\u00F3var, who cast the young actor in his movie debut Labyrinth of Passion (1982). Banderas and Almodovar joined forces in making innovative and sexually provocative movies during the 1980s. In 1984, Banderas made headlines in Spain with his performance as a gay man, making his first male-to-male on-screen kiss in Almodovar\u0027s Law of Desire (1987). Banderas\u0027 long and fruitful collaboration with Pedro Almod\u00F3var eventually prepared him for international recognition that came with his work in the Academy Award-nominated film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988). In 1991, he appeared as an object of Madonna\u0027s affection in Madonna: Truth or Dare (1991).In 1992, Banderas made his Hollywood debut with The Mambo Kings (1992). Because he did not speak English at that time, his dialogue for the movie was taught to him phonetically. Banderas shot to international fame with his sensitive performance as a lover of Tom Hanks\u0027 AIDS-infected lawyer in Philadelphia (1993), then played opposite Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in\nInterview with the Vampire (1994). Banderas further established himself as one of Hollywood\u0027s leading men after co-starring in Evita (1996) opposite Madonna in the title role. In 1998, he won acclaim for his portrayal of Zorro, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones, in The Mask of Zorro (1998). For the role as Zorro, Banderas took training with the Olympic national fencing team in Spain, and practiced his moves with real steel swords, then he used the lighter aluminum swords in the movie. He also took a month-long course of horse-riding before the filming. He later returned to the role in The Legend of Zorro (2005). In 1999, Banderas made his directorial debut in Crazy in Alabama (1999), starring his wife, Melanie Griffith. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros opposite Salma Hayek in Frida (2002). He voiced Puss in Boots in the Shrek franchise.Banderas established himself as internationally known Latin heartthrob with charismatic looks, and was chosen as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People magazine in 1996. He won numerous awards and nominations for his works in film, including three ALMA awards and three Golden Globe nominations, among many other. From 1996 to 2014, Banderas was married to American actress Melanie Griffith and the couple have one daughter, Stella (born 1996). Outside of his acting profession, Banderas has been a passionate soccer fan and a staunch supporter of the Real Madrid Football Club.

    "Info": "Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair in Alameda County, California, along with his fraternal twin brother, Paul Vincent. He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists\u0027 housing project in New York City\u0027s Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father\u0027s background, Diesel has said that he himself is \u0022definitely a person of colour\u0022.His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin\u0027s fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York\u0027s hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \u0022Feature Films at used Car Prices\u0022 by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Saving Private Ryan (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of The Iron Giant (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin\u0027s career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002), The Pacifier (2005), Fast \u0026amp; Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast \u0026amp; Furious 6 (2013), and Furious 7 (2015).

    "Info": "Kevin Spacey Fowler, better known by his stage name Kevin Spacey, is an American actor of screen and stage, film director, producer, screenwriter and singer. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)In Broadway theatre, Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013, Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, \u0022the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person\u0022. In October 2017, he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had had sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as gay.There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His middle name, \u0022Spacey,\u0022 which he uses as his stage name, is from his paternal grandmother. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister\u0027s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played \u0022Captain von Trapp\u0022 opposite classmate Mare Winningham\u0027s \u0022Maria\u0022 in \u0022The Sound of Music\u0022 (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of \u0022Henry VI\u0022.Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the \u0022real world\u0022 of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen\u0027s \u0022Ghosts\u0022. He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe\u0027s \u0022Hurlyburly\u0022). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s \u0022Long Day\u0027s Journey Into Night\u0022. While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as \u0022Uncle Louie\u0022 in Neil Simon\u0027s Broadway hit \u0022Lost in Yonkers\u0022 and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O\u0027Neill\u0027s \u0022The Iceman Cometh\u0022.Spacey\u0027s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn (1986). Deemed more of a \u0022character actor\u0022 than a \u0022leading man\u0022, he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain \u0022Mel Profitt\u0022 on the TV series Wiseguy (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Swimming with Sharks (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects (1995).The \u0022Suspects\u0022 role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher\u0027s thriller Se7en (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino\u0027s Looking for Richard (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Albino Alligator (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban comedy American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences\u0027 imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he\u0027s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show\u0027s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017, he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller Baby Driver (2017).",

    "Info": "Van Damme was born Jean-Claude Camille Fran\u00E7ois Van Varenberg in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium, to\nEliana and Eug\u00E8ne Van Varenberg, an accountant. \u0022The Muscles from\nBrussels\u0022 started\nmartial arts at the age of eleven. His father introduced him to martial\narts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van\nDamme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate\n(National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master\nClaude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme\ntrained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He\nwon the European professional karate association\u0027s middleweight\nchampionship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter\nin the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he\nleft his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen,\nJean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career.Over the next\n6-years, he competed in both full-contact and semi-contact matches. He\ndebuted under his birth name of Jean Claude Van Varenberg. In his first\nmatch, Jean-Claude was staggered by a round-house kick thrown by fellow\ncountryman, Toon Van Oostrum in Brussels, Belgium. Van Damme was badly\nstunned, but came back to knockout Van Oostrum moments later. In 1977,\nat the WAKO Open International in Antwerp, Belgium, Jean-Claude lost a\ndecision to fellow team mate Patrick Teugels in a semi-contact match.\nAt the 1978 Challenge De Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st\nTrials),Jean-Claude placed 2nd in the semi-contact division. He\ndefeated twenty-five opponents during the week long tournament, but\nlost in the finals to Angelo Spataro from the Naha Club. Later in 1978,\nJean-Claude lost a 3-round match for the Belgium Lightweight\nChampionship (semi-contact) to his fellow team-mate to Patrick Teugels.In 1979, Jean-Claude traveled to the United States of America, to\nTampa, Florida. In his first and only match against a United States\nopponent, Van Damme faced \u0027Sherman \u0027Big Train\u0027Bergman\u0027, a kick-boxer\nfrom Miami Beach, Florida. For the first and only time in his career,\nJean-Claude was knocked to the canvas after absorbing a powerful left\nhook from Bergman. However, Jean-Claude climbed off the canvas and with\na perfectly timed ax-kick, knocked Bergman out in 56 seconds of the\nfirst round. Jean-Claude was a member of the Belgium team which\ncompeted on December 26, 1979 at the La Coupe Fancois Persoons Karate\nTournament which was sanctioned by the Federation bruxelloise de\nKarate. Van Damme\u0027s final match victory enabled his team to win the\nEuropean Team Karate Championship. In Full-Contact karate, Jean-Claude\nknocked out England\u0027s Micheal Heming in 46 seconds of the first round.\nIn 1980, Van Damme knocked out France\u0027s Georges Verlugels in 2 rounds\nof a match fought under kick-boxing rules. Jean-Claude wanted to defeat\nhis rival Patrick Teugels. At the Forest Nationals in Brussels, on\nMarch 8, 1980, Jean-Claude knocked Teugels down and Teugels suffered a\nnose injury and was unable to continue. Jean-Claude was awarded a first\nround victory.Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following\na knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a\n18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of\n41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt\ninsured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to\nLos Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer,\npizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to\nChuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a\nclub. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie\nMissing in Action (1984), but\nit wasn\u0027t good enough to get anybody\u0027s attention. Then in 1984 he got a\nrole as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie\nNo Retreat, No Surrender (1985).\nThen one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a\nproducer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts\nabilities which led to a role in\nBloodsport (1988). But the movie,\nfilmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved\nfor almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme\ndid not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it.\nThey finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then\ninto the U.S. Shot on a meager $1.5 million dollar budget, it became a\nU.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about $50 million\nworldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational\naction star Jean-Claude Van Damme.His martial arts assets, highlighted\nby his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent\u0027s head during a leaping\n360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher\nbudgeted movies like Cyborg (1989),\nLionheart (1990),\nDouble Impact (1991) and\nUniversal Soldier (1992). In\n1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit\nTimecop (1994). But in the meantime, his\npersonal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage,\nfollowed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his\nprojects began to tank at the box office -\nThe Quest (1996), which he directed;\nMaximum Risk (1996) and\nDouble Team (1997). The three films\nmade less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife\nGladys Portugues and restarted his lost\ncareer to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his\nproblems and made movies like\nReplicant (2001),\nDerailed (2002), and\nIn Hell (2003) which did averagely in box\noffice terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in\nthose movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in\ndifferent action tones.",

    "Info": "Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer \u0022Jenny\u0022 (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale\u0027s childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \u0022The Nerd\u0022. A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg\u0027s eye, leading to Bale\u0027s well-documented role in Empire of the Sun (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh\u0027s 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare\u0027s Henry V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Little Women (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron\u0027s adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \u0022Entertainment Weekly\u0022 crowned Bale one of the \u0022Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\u0022 of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \u0022Most Creative People in Entertainment\u0022, and \u0022Premiere\u0022 lauded him as one of the \u0022Hottest Leading Men Under 30\u0022.Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Reign of Fire (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and The Machinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale\u0027s physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60\u002B pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale\u0027s abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan\u0027s definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman \u0026amp; Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman\u0027s phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006\u0027s Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog\u0027s feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in The Prestige (2006), the remake of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I\u0027m Not There (2007).Anticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale\u0027s graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale\u0027s next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann\u0027s Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)\u0027s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \u0022Irish\u0022 Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic The Flowers of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.",

    "Info": "Bruce Lee remains the greatest icon of martial arts cinema and a key figure of modern popular media. Had it not been for Bruce Lee and his\nmovies in the early 1970s, it\u0027s arguable whether or not the martial arts film genre would have ever penetrated and influenced mainstream\nNorth American and European cinema and audiences the way it has over the past four decades. The influence of East Asian martial arts cinema can be seen today in so many other film genres including comedies, action, drama, science fiction, horror and animation... and they all have their roots in the phenomenon that was Bruce Lee.Lee was born Lee Jun Fan November 27, 1940 in San Francisco, the son of Lee Hoi Chuen, a singer with the Cantonese Opera. Approximately one year later, the family returned to Kowloon in Hong Kong and at the age of five, a young Bruce begins appearing in children\u0027s roles in minor films including The Birth of Mankind (1946) and Fu gui fu yun (1948). At the age of 12, Bruce commenced attending La Salle College. Bruce was later beaten up by a street gang, which inspired him to take up martial arts training under the tutelage of Sifu Yip Man who schooled Bruce in wing chun kung fu for a period of approximately five years. This was the only formalized martial arts training ever undertaken by Lee. The talented and athletic Bruce also took up cha-cha dancing and, at age 18, won a major dance championship in Hong Kong.However, his temper and quick fists got him in trouble with the Hong Kong police on numerous occasions. His parents suggested that he head\noff to the United States. Lee landed in San Francisco\u0027s Chinatown in 1959 and worked in a close relative\u0027s restaurant. He eventually made\nhis way to Seattle, Washington, where he enrolled at university to study philosophy and found the time to practice his beloved kung fu\ntechniques. In 1963, Lee met Linda Lee Cadwell (aka Linda Emery) (later his wife) and also opened his first kung fu school at 4750 University Way. During the early half of the 1960s, Lee became associated with many key martial arts figures in the United States, including kenpo karate expert Ed Parker and tae kwon do master Jhoon Rhee. He made guest appearances at notable martial arts events including the Long Beach Nationals. Through one of these tournaments Bruce met Hollywood hair-stylist Jay Sebring who introduced him to television producer William Dozier. Based on the runaway success of Batman (1966), Dozier was keen to bring the cartoon character the Green Hornet to television and was on the lookout for an East Asian actor to play the Green Hornet\u0027s sidekick, Kato. Around this time Bruce also opened a second kung fu school in Oakland, California and relocated to Oakland to be closer to Hollywood.Bruce\u0027s screen test was successful, and The Green Hornet (1966) starring Van Williams aired in 1966-1967 with mixed success. His fight scenes were sometimes obscured by unrevealing camera angles, but his dedication was such that he insisted his character behave like a perfect bodyguard, keeping his eyes on whoever might be a threat to his employer except when the script made this impossible. The show was canceled after only one season (twenty-six episodes), but by this time Lee was receiving more fan mail than the series\u0027 nominal star. He then opened a third branch of his kung fu school in Los Angeles and began providing personalized martial arts training to celebrities including film stars Steve McQueen and James Coburn as well as screenwriter Stirling Silliphant. In addition he refined his prior knowledge of wing chun and incorporated aspects of other fighting styles such as traditional boxing and Okinawan karate. He also developed his own unique style Jeet Kune Do (Way of the Intercepting Fist). Another film opportunity then came his way as he landed the small role of a stand over man named Winslow Wong who intimidates private eye James Garner in Marlowe (1969). Wong pays a visit to Garner and proceeds to demolish the investigator\u0027s office with his fists and feet, finishing off with a spectacular high kick that shatters the light fixture. With this further exposure of his talents, Bruce then scored several guest appearances as a martial arts instructor to blind private eye James Franciscus on the television series Longstreet (1971).With his minor success in Hollywood and money in his pocket, Bruce returned for a visit to Hong Kong and was approached by film producer\nRaymond Man-Wai Chow who had recently started Golden Harvest productions. Chow was keen to utilize Lee\u0027s strong popularity amongst young Chinese fans, and offered him the lead role in The Big Boss (1971). In it, Lee plays a distant cousin coming to join relatives working at an ice house, where murder, corruption, and drug-running lead to his character\u0027s adventures and display of Kung-Fu expertise. The film was directed by Wei Lo, shot in Thailand on a very low budget and in terrible living conditions for cast and crew. However, when it opened in Hong Kong the film was an enormous hit. Chow knew he had struck box office gold with Lee and quickly assembled another script entitled Fist of Fury (1972). The second film (with a slightly bigger budget) was again directed by Wei Lo and was set in Shanghai in the year 1900, with Lee returning to his school to find that his beloved master has been poisoned by the local Japanese karate school. Once again he uncovers the evildoers and sets about seeking revenge on those responsible for murdering his teacher and intimidating his school. The film features several superb fight sequences and, at the film\u0027s conclusion, Lee refuses to surrender to the Japanese police and seemingly leaps to his death in a hail of police bullets.Once more, Hong Kong streets were jammed with thousands of fervent Chinese movie fans who could not get enough of the fearless Bruce Lee, and his second film went on to break the box office records set by the first! Lee then set up his own production company, Concord Productions, and set about guiding his film career personally by writing, directing and acting in his next film, The Way of the Dragon (1972). A bigger budget meant better locations and opponents, with the new film set in Rome, Italy and additionally starring hapkido expert In-shik Hwang, karate legend Robert Wall and seven-time U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris. Bruce plays a seemingly simple country boy sent to assist at a cousin\u0027s restaurant in Rome and finds his cousins are being bullied by local thugs for protection.By now, Lee\u0027s remarkable success in East Asia had come to the attention of Hollywood film executives and a script was hastily written pitching him as a secret agent penetrating an island fortress. Warner Bros. financed the film and also insisted on B-movie tough guy John Saxon starring alongside Lee to give the film wider appeal. The film culminates with another show-stopping fight sequence between Lee and the key villain, Han, in a maze of mirrors. Shooting was completed in and around Hong Kong in early 1973 and in the subsequent weeks Bruce was involved in completing overdubs and looping for the final cut. Various reports from friends and co-workers cite that he was not feeling well during this period and on July 20, 1973 he lay down at the apartment of actress Betty Ting Pei after taking a headache medicine called Equagesic and was later unable to be revived. A doctor was called and Lee was taken to hospital by ambulance and pronounced dead that evening. The official finding was death due to a cerebral edema, caused by a reaction to the headache tablet Equagesic.Fans worldwide were shattered that their virile idol had passed at such a young age, and nearly thirty thousand fans filed past his coffin\nin Hong Kong. A second, much smaller ceremony was held in Seattle, Washington and Bruce was laid to rest at Lake View Cemetary in Seattle with pall bearers including Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Dan Inosanto. Enter the Dragon (1973) was later released in the mainland United States, and was a huge hit with audiences there, which then prompted National General films to actively distribute his three prior movies to U.S. theatres... each was a box office smash.Fans throughout the world were still hungry for more Bruce Lee films and thus remaining footage (completed before his death) of Lee fighting several opponents including Dan Inosanto, Hugh O\u0027Brian and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was crafted into another film titled Game of Death (1978). The film used a lookalike and shadowy camera work to be substituted for the real Lee in numerous scenes. The film is a poor addition to the line-up and is only saved by the final twenty minutes and the footage of the real Bruce Lee battling his way up the tower. Amazingly, this same shoddy process was used to create Game of Death II (1980), with a lookalike and more stunt doubles interwoven with a few brief minutes of footage of the real Bruce Lee.Tragically, his son Brandon Lee, an actor and martial artist like his father, was killed in a freak accident on the set of The Crow (1994). Bruce Lee was not only an amazing athlete and martial artist but he possessed genuine superstar charisma and through a handful of films he\nleft behind an indelible impression on the tapestry of modern cinema.",

    "Info": "Macaulay Culkin, one of the most famous American child stars, was born\non August 26, 1980 in New York City, New York, USA, as the third of seven\nchildren of his father\nKit Culkin (a former stage\nand child actor and also Macaulay\u0027s former manager) and mother\nPatricia Brentrup. He is the brother of Shane Culkin, Dakota Culkin, Kieran Culkin, Quinn Culkin, Christian Culkin, and Rory Culkin, most of whom have also acted. Macaulay\u0027s mother,\nwho is from North Dakota, is of German and Norwegian descent.\nMacaulay\u0027s father, from Manhattan, has Irish, German, English,\nSwiss-German, and French ancestry.\u0022Mack\u0022, as he\u0027s known to his close friends and family, first came into\nshowbiz at the age of 4, appearing in a string of Off-Broadway shows\nsuch as the New York City Ballet\u0027s The Nutcracker and, by 8 years-old,\nthe films\nRocket Gibraltar (1988) and\nSee You in the Morning (1989),\nwhich included him in the rare company of kids who have received rave\nreviews from The New Yorker and The New York Times.By the age of 9, the young actor had nearly upstaged star\nJohn Candy in\nUncle Buck (1989) (his deadpan\ninterrogation of Candy was Buck\u0027s funniest scene). Then, in 1990,\nwriter John Hughes turned his\nfinished Home Alone (1990) script over\nto director Chris Columbus with a\nsuggestion to consider Culkin for the lead. Though Macaulay was the\nfirst kid Columbus saw, he was skeptical about having him in the lead\nand saw over 200 other possible actors and he admitted that no one came\nas close to being as good as Culkin. By the callback interview, Mack\nhad memorized two scenes, and Columbus was sure he found his \u0022Kevin\nMcCallister\u0022. The movie grossed more than $285 million in the US alone,\nbecoming one of the highest grossing movies of all time and making\nMacaulay Culkin one of the biggest movie stars of the time.His next big project was My Girl (1991)\nin which he played \u0022Thomas J. Sennett\u0022, a boy who seems to be allergic\nto everything. Despite some controversy over the ending, the film was\nreleased anyway and proved to be another hit film for Mack (and\nfeatured his very first kiss). In 1992 came\nHome Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992),\nwhich grossed more than $172 million in the US alone. In 1993 came\nThe Good Son (1993), which was the\nfirst role to depart from his cute kid comedies. He played a murderous\nlittle demon named Henry. He got the role when his powerhouse\nnegotiator/manager/father Kit Culkin said that he would pull Mack out\nof\nHome Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992)\nunless he was given the psychotic boy lead in\nThe Good Son (1993). He was also\ngiven a salary of $5 million for the film.In 1994, at the age of 14, came a string of duds,\nThe Pagemaster (1994),\nGetting Even with Dad (1994)\nand Richie Rich (1994). He was paid\n$8 million for the last two, the highest salary ever paid for a child\nstar. Many people believed Mack had lost his touch, though, because he\nwas no longer that cute tiny kid they saw in\nHome Alone (1990). In 1995 his\nparents, who were never married, separated and started a greedy legal\nbattle over the custody of their kids and Mack\u0027s fortune. In 1996, the\nyoung actor had reportedly said he wouldn\u0027t accept any roles until his\nparents settled their custody dispute. That case would not be resolved\nuntil April 1997 when Kit Culkin relinquished control to Brentrup.In 1998, Macaulay married actress\nRachel Miner, but separated in 2000\nbecause Rachel wanted to start a family and Mack wanted to get back\ninto acting. There has been a gap of eight years since 1994\u0027s\nRichie Rich (1994), and although he\nmade a\n\u0027comeback\u0027 on stage in 2001, appearing in a London production of\n\u0022Madame Melville\u0022, and also portrayed\nMichael Alig\nin Party Monster (2003); with an\nestimated fortune of $17 million he clearly never has to work again -\nif the roles don\u0027t appeal to him.",

    "Info": "Jack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter, is a three-time Academy Award winner and twelve-time nominee. Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received an Oscar nomination in every decade from the \u002760s through the \u002700s.Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show business. Jack\u0027s mother\u0027s ancestry was Irish, and smaller amounts of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh.Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960).Nicholson\u0027s first turn in the director\u0027s chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson\u0027s film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces (1970). Nicholson\u0027s other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski\u0027s noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick\u0027s adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s novel The Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Terms of Endearment (1983), which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Prizzi\u0027s Honor (1985), and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton\u0027s Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as A Few Good Men (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996).Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson\u0027s acting range reappeared in The Departed (2006), the actor\u0027s most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in About Schmidt (2002), Something\u0027s Gotta Give (2003), and The Bucket List (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute\u0027s Life Achievement award in 1994.Nicholson has six children by five different women: Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963) from his only marriage to Sandra Knight, which ended in 1966; Caleb Goddard (b. 1970) with Five Easy Pieces (1970) co-star Susan Anspach, who was automatically adopted by Anspach\u0027s then-husband Mark Goddard; Honey Hollman (b. 1982) with Danish supermodel Winnie Hollman; Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with minor actress Rebecca Broussard; and Tessa Gourin (b. 1994) with real estate agent Jennine Marie Gourin. Nicholson\u0027s longest relationship was the 17 nonmonogamous years he spent with Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard announced she was pregnant with his child.",

He received the audition for his debut role as Bacon in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) through French Connection, for whom he was modeling. They became a major investor in the film and introduced Jason to Guy Ritchie, who invited him to audition for a part in the film by challenging him to impersonate an illegal street vendor and convince him to purchase fake jewelry.

After Snatch (2000) came Turn It Up (2000) with US music star Ja Rule, followed by a supporting actor role in the sci-fi film Ghosts of Mars (2001), Jet Li\u0027s The One (2001) and another screen partnership with Vinnie Jones in Mean Machine (2001) under Guy Ritchie\u0027s and Matthew Vaughn\u0027s SKA Films.

    "Info": "Kate Beckinsale was born on 26 July 1973 in West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, Middlesex, England, and has resided in London for most of her life. Her mother is Judy Loe, who has appeared in a number of British dramas and sitcoms and continues to work as an actress, predominantly in British television productions. Her father was Richard Beckinsale, born in Nottingham, England. He starred in a number of popular British television comedies during the 1970s, most notably the series Rising Damp (1974), Porridge (1974) and The Lovers (1970). He passed away tragically early in 1979 at the age of 31, when Kate was five years old, and her mother Judy Loe never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother.Kate attended the private school Godolphin and Latymer School in London for her grade and primary school education. In her teens she twice won the British bookseller W.H. Smith Young Writers\u0027 competition - once for three short stories and once for three poems. After a tumultuous adolescence (a bout of anorexia - cured - and a smoking habit which continues to this day), she gradually took up the profession of acting.Her major acting debut came in a TV film about World War II called One Against the Wind (1991), filmed in Luxembourg during the summer of 1991. It first aired on American television that December. Kate began attending Oxford University\u0027s New College in the fall of 1991, majoring in French and Russian literature. She had already decided that she wanted to act, but to broaden her horizons she chose university over drama school. While in her first year at Oxford, Kate received her big break in Kenneth Branagh\u0027s film adaptation of William Shakespeare\u0027s Much Ado About Nothing (1993). Kate worked in three other films while attending Oxford, beginning with a part in the medieval historical drama Royal Deceit (1994), cast as Ethel. The film was shot during the spring of 1993 on location in Denmark, and she filmed her supporting part during New College\u0027s Easter break. Later in the summer of that year she played the lead in the contemporary mystery drama Uncovered (1994). Before she went back to school, her third year at university was spent at Oxford\u0027s study-abroad program in Paris, France, immersing herself in the French language, Parisian culture and French cigarettes.A year away from the academic community and living on her own in the French capital caused her to re-evaluate the direction of her life. She faced a choice: continue with school or concentrate on her flourishing acting career. After much thought, she chose the acting career. In the spring of 1994 Kate left Oxford, after finishing three years of study. Kate appeared in the BBC/Thames Television satire Cold Comfort Farm (1995), filmed in London and East Sussex during late summer 1994 and which opened to spectacular reviews in the United States, grossing over $5 million during its American run. It was re-released to U.K. theaters in the spring of 1997.Acting on the stage consumed the first part of 1995; she toured in England with the Thelma Holts Theatre Company production of Anton Chekhov\u0027s \u0022The Seagull\u0022. After turning down several mediocre scripts \u0022and going nearly berserk with boredom\u0022, she waited seven months before another interesting role was offered to her. Her big movie of 1995 was the romance/horror movie Haunted (1995), starring opposite Aidan Quinn and John Gielgud, and filmed in West Sussex. In this film she wanted to play \u0022an object of desire\u0022, unlike her past performances where her characters were much less the siren and more the worldly innocent. Kate\u0027s first film project of 1996 was the British ITV production of Jane Austen\u0027s novel Emma (1996). Her last film of 1996 was the comedy Shooting Fish (1997), filmed at Shepperton Studios in London during early fall. She played the part of Georgie, an altruistic con artist. She had a daughter, Lily, in 1999 with actor Michael Sheen.",

    "Info": "Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all\ntime, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented\nLaurence Olivier in terms of esteem.\nUnlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando\nconcentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage\nadieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his\nstar began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering\nhis talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on\nsucceeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years\nafter he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie\nversion of Tennessee Williams\u0027\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\nand a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u0027s\nApocalypse Now (1979), all\nAmerican actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was\nBrando. It was if the shadow of\nJohn Barrymore, the great\nAmerican actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom,\ndominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any\nother actor so dominate the public\u0027s consciousness of what WAS an actor\nbefore or since Brando\u0027s 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a\ncultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors\ncirca 1950, such as Paul Muni and\nFredric March. Only the luster of\nSpencer Tracy\u0027s reputation hasn\u0027t\ndimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However,\nneither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by\nthe force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to\nMarlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically\ninclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. \u0022Bud\u0022 Brando was\none of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish;\nhis surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named\n\u0022Brandau.\u0022 His oldest sister\nJocelyn Brando was also an actress,\ntaking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and\nmentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another\nNebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community\nPlayhouse. Frannie, Brando\u0027s other sibling, was a visual artist. Both\nBrando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City,\nJocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to\nescape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant\nfather and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big\nApple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was\nthe only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was\ndetermined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had\nnothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due\nto a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military\nAcademy, Brando Sr.\u0027s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as\nincorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic\nparents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently\nintoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act\nfor her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and\nlove. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her,\nparticularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which\ninformed his character Paul in\nLast Tango in Paris (1972)\n(\u0022Last Tango in Paris\u0022) when he is recalling his childhood for his\nyoung lover Jeanne. \u0022I don\u0027t have many good memories,\u0022 Paul confesses,\nand neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to\nthe town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in\nthe drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young\nboy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his\ntalent, producing the pearls of his performances.\nAnthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning\nco-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told\nBrando\u0027s first wife Anna Kashfi, \u0022I admire\nMarlon\u0027s talent, but I don\u0027t envy the pain that created it.\u0022Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator\u0027s\nDramatic Workshop at New York\u0027s New School, and was mentored by\nStella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish\nTheatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the\n\u0022emotional memory\u0022 technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and\nimpresario\nKonstantin Stanislavski, whose\nmotto was \u0022Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.\u0022 The\nresults of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him\nfor a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and\nculture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in\n\u0022I Remember Mama,\u0022 a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando\nwas invited by talent scouts from several different studios to\nscreen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let\nhimself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would\nmake his film debut quite some time later in\nFred Zinnemann\u0027s\nThe Men (1950) for producer\nStanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic\nsoldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding\non the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni\nJohn Garfield, the predecessor\nclosest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it\nwas Garfield whom producer\nIrene Mayer Selznick had chosen to\nplay the lead in a new\nTennessee Williams play she was about\nto produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an\nownership stake in \u0022A Streetcar Named Desire.\u0022\nBurt Lancaster was next approached, but\ncouldn\u0027t get out of a prior film commitment. Then director\nElia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had\ndirected to great effect in\nMaxwell Anderson\u0027s play\n\u0022Truckline Caf\u00E9,\u0022 in which Brando co-starred with\nKarl Malden, who was to remain a close\nfriend for the next 60 years.During the production of \u0022Truckline Caf\u00E9,\u0022 Kazan had found that\nBrando\u0027s presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep\nMarlon near other major characters\u0027 stage business, as the audience\ncould not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando\u0027s\ncharacter re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him\nupstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience\ncould still see him as Karl Malden and\nothers played out their scene within the caf\u00E9 set. When he eventually\nentered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young\nPauline Kael, arriving late to the play,\nhad to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed\nthe young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not\nlook back until her escort commented that the young man was a great\nactor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger\nthan the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting\nbetween Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando\nwould make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a\nyounger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a\nvicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be\nattributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was\ndissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to\nbring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his\ncharacterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of\nJessica Tandy\u0027s Blanche Dubois. During the\nout-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando\u0027s magnetism was\nattracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to\nStanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience\u0027s\nsympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were\nidentifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter,\nbroaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more\nof a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred,\nsmitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley\nbecause Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He\nthought Vivien Leigh, who played the part\nin the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS\nBlanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness\nand nymphomania. Brando\u0027s appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen\nrevolutionized American acting by introducing \u0022The Method\u0022 into\nAmerican consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler\u0027s\nstudy at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky\u0027s theories that she\nsubsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic\nstyle of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the\nactor with the character\u0027s emotions. Adler took first place among\nBrando\u0027s acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an\nunsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and\ncosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn\u0027t like the term \u0022The Method,\u0022 which quickly became the\nprominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as\nLee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando\ndenounced Strasberg in his autobiography \u0022Songs My Mother Taught Me\u0022\n(1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had\nbeen Brando\u0027s mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg\nalong with Kazan and Stella Adler\u0027s\nhusband, Harold Clurman, all Group\nTheatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the\ndidactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the\ncraft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography \u0022A Life\u0022\nclaimed that Brando\u0027s genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler\nhad given him. Adler\u0027s method emphasized that authenticity in acting is\nachieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional\nexperienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that\nBrando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and\nthose who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by\nemploying The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor,\nthat he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut\ninstincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young\nactor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando\u0027s genius, thought that\nall it took was to find a character\u0027s motivation, empathize with the\ncharacter through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all\non stage to become the character. That\u0027s not how the superbly trained\nBrando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your\naverage American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando\u0027s\nart, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951),\nfor which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations,\nBrando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances -\nin Viva Zapata! (1952),\nJulius Caesar (1953) and the summit\nof his early career, Kazan\u0027s\nOn the Waterfront (1954). For\nhis \u0022Waterfront\u0022 portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy,\nthe washed-up pug who \u0022coulda been a contender,\u0022 Brando won his first\nOscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause\nJohnny in The Wild One (1953) (\u0022What\nare you rebelling against?\u0022 Johnny is asked. \u0022What have ya got?\u0022 is his\nreply), the first wave of his career was, according to\nJon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious\npresentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director\nJohn Huston said his performance of\nMarc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark\nroom, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier\nShakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his\nrepertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting,\nspawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and\nSteve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the \u0022New Brando,\u0022 such as\nWarren Beatty in Kazan\u0027s\nSplendor in the Grass (1961).\n\u0022We are all Brando\u0027s children,\u0022\nJack Nicholson pointed out in\n1972. \u0022He gave us our freedom.\u0022 He was truly \u0022The Godfather\u0022 of\nAmerican acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like D\u00E9sir\u00E9e (1954) and The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn\u0027t sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely\nestablish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star,\nalthough that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his\nearly career, Sayonara (1957) (for which\nhe received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his\nhand at directing a film, the well-reviewed\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961) that he made\nfor his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his\nmother\u0027s maiden name). Stanley Kubrick\nhad been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites\nin which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and\nKubrick was sacked. According to his widow\nChristiane Kubrick, Stanley believed\nthat Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning\nup a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents\na foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during\nproduction of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing\nthe film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut.\nParamount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that\nBrando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad\nLongworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the\nheavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a\nmatter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one\u0027s\nenvironment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a\ngray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This\nattitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian\nDiestl in the film he made before shooting\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961),\nEdward Dmytryk\u0027s filming of\nIrwin Shaw\u0027s novel\nThe Young Lions (1958). Shaw\ndenounced Brando\u0027s performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as\nthe film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would\nhave for more than a decade.One-Eyed Jacks (1961) generated\nrespectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were\nexorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a\ndeficit. A film essentially is \u0022made\u0022 in the editing room, and Brando\nfound cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio\neventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in\nhandling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed\nanother film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct\nthemselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando\nappeared in Sidney Lumet\u0027s film version of\nTennessee Williams\u0027 play \u0022Orpheus Descending,\u0022\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960) which\nteamed him with fellow Oscar winners\nAnna Magnani and\nJoanne Woodward. Following in\nElizabeth Taylor\u0027s trailblazing\nfootsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million\nsalary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this\nre-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic\nHollis Alpert had published a book \u0022Brando\nand the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski\u0022). Critics and audiences waiting for\nanother incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were\ndisappointed when the renamed\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960)\nfinally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)\nand\nSuddenly, Last Summer (1959)\nburning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of\nMotion Picture Arts \u0026amp; Sciences,\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960) was a\nfailure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961) in 1961 and\nthen by a failure of a more monumental kind:\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962),\na remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962)\nafter turning down the lead in the\nDavid Lean classic\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\nbecause he didn\u0027t want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a\ncamel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages\nas the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal\nphotography, highly respected director\nCarol Reed (an eventual Academy Award\nwinner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner\nLewis Milestone, was shunted aside by\nBrando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself.\nThe long shoot became so notorious that President\nJohn F. Kennedy asked director\nBilly Wilder at a cocktail party not \u0022when\u0022\nbut \u0022if\u0022 the \u0022Bounty\u0022 shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one\nof its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar\nnomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to\ngo into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20\nmillion, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for\ninflation.Brando and Taylor, whose\nCleopatra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th\nCentury-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more\nthan twice that of Brando\u0027s\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962)),\nwere pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the\npampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking\nscapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial\npressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and\nby the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains,\ncausing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in\nthe 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking\nto replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of\nThe Ten Commandments (1956)\nand Ben-Hur (1959), were the real\nculprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found\nit impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box\noffice.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of\npublicity from her adulterous romance with\nCleopatra (1963) co-star\nRichard Burton, remained hot\nuntil the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle\nBoom! (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end\nof the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he\nworked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The\nindustry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he\ncontinued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as\nThe Ugly American (1963),\nThe Appaloosa (1966) and\nReflections in a Golden Eye (1967).\nFor every \u0022Reflections,\u0022 though, there seemed to be two or three\noutright debacles, such as\nBedtime Story (1964), Morituri (1965), The Chase (1966),\nA Countess from Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968),\nThe Night of the Following Day (1969).\nBy the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture\nBurn! (1969) in Colombia with\nGillo Pontecorvo in the director\u0027s\nchair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous\nfive years with such top directors as\nArthur Penn,\nJohn Huston and the legendary\nCharles Chaplin, and with such\ntop-drawer co-stars as David Niven,\nYul Brynner,\nSophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his\npotential to be America\u0027s answer to\nLaurence Olivier, as his friend\nWilliam Redfield limned the dilemma in\nhis book \u0022Letters from an Actor\u0022 (1967), a memoir about Redfield\u0027s\nappearance in Burton\u0027s 1964 theatrical production of \u0022Hamlet.\u0022 By\nfailing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries,\nsomething British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando\nhad stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical\nrepertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for\nan American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while\nMethod actors such as Rod Steiger tried to\ncreate an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their\nking was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his\ntalent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was\na crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as\nThe Appaloosa (1966) and\nReflections in a Golden Eye (1967)\nthat Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life,\ncritics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing\nto live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando\u0027s political\nactivism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native\nAmericans\u0027 rights, followed by his participation in the Southern\nChristian Leadership Conference\u0027s March on Washington in 1963, and\nfollowed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not\nwin him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de\nfacto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially,\nat least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply\nwould not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando\nwould not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was\nFortune\u0027s fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of\nJohn Barrymore, a similarly\ngifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them\naway. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham,\nevidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious\nCandy (1968), seemingly because the\nmaterial was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the\n1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor\nElia Kazan, a relationship that had soured\ndue to Kazan\u0027s friendly testimony naming names before the notorious\nHouse un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this,\ntoo, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of\nKazan\u0027s film adaptation of his own novel,\nThe Arrangement (1969). However,\nafter the assassination of\nMartin Luther King, Brando backed out\nof the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film\nafter this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite\nbox-office king Paul Newman in a\nsurefire script,\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969),\nBrando decided to make Burn! (1969)\nwith Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and\ncolonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of\nprogressive critics and cultural arbiters such as\nHoward Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to \u0022Turn of the Screw\u0022 and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from\nOrson Welles, whose greatness lay in\nfilm making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard\nBurton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his\nown film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike\nthe public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he\nhimself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando\u0027s\nproblem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten\ntoo much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured\nby normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando\u0027s personality\nand his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow\nup outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in\nprint in the mid-\u002750s and had as much to do with the public perception\nof the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors\nwere ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good\nactor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare\ngenius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an\nintelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not\nthe actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the\nother arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert\nover his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled\nby a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema\nthat a performance, as is a film, is \u0022created\u0022 in the cutting room,\nthus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had\ntried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic\nenterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and\nthe film\u0027s performances are made. This lack of control over his art was\nthe root of Brando\u0027s discontent with acting, with movies, and,\neventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in\nmovie actors, as long as \u0022they\u0022 were at the top of the box-office\ncharts. Hollywood was a matter of \u0022they\u0022 and not the work, and Brando\nbecame disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in\nMartin Luther King\u0027s 1963 March on\nWashington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his\ngeneration. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role\nin the early 1960s with the excuse \u0022How can I act when people are\nstarving in India?,\u0022 Heston believes that it was this attitude, the\ninability to separate one\u0027s idealism from one\u0027s work, that prevented\nBrando from reaching his potential. As\nRod Steiger once said, Brando had it all,\ngreat stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a\ntrip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando\u0027s\nchildren even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When\nJames Mason\u0027 was asked in 1971 who\nwas the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let\nhis career go belly-up, it had to be\nGeorge C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only\nLaurence Olivier would suffice, but\nLord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one\nactor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had\nassembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon\nBrando. Francis Ford Coppola won\nthe fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and\nParamount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of\nall-time, The Godfather (1972), a\ngangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American\nfilms of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone\nwith his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly\nscandalous\nLast Tango in Paris (1972)\n(\u0022Last Tango in Paris\u0022), the first film dealing explicitly with\nsexuality in which an actor of Brando\u0027s stature had participated. He\nwas now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the\ngreatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put\nhim on the cover of \u0022Time\u0022 magazine and would make him the highest-paid\nactor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade.\nLittle did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many\nprojects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best\nacting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well\nat the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never\nreached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away.\nHe would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done\nin Last Tango in Paris (1972),\u0022 a performance that embarrassed him, according\nto his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being\nthe \u0022auteur,\u0022 or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of\n\u0022Tango\u0022 were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The\nimprovisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and\nthe scripted improvisations were shot the next day.\nPauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics\nin that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of\nher generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said\nBrando\u0027s performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972) had revolutionized the art of\nfilm. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother\u0027s attention; Brando,\nwho believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the\nworld engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted\nfrom other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a\nchildish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have\nagreed with Sam Peckinpah\u0027s summation of\nPauline Kael: \u0022Pauline\u0027s a brilliant critic\nbut sometimes she\u0027s just cracking walnuts with her ass.\u0022 He probably would have done so in a\nsimulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major\nrole for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after\nJack Nicholson in\nArthur Penn\u0027s\nThe Missouri Breaks (1976), a\nwestern that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando\u0027s performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of\ncapital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the\nSalkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of\nthe gross for 13 days work on\nSuperman (1978). Factoring in inflation,\nthe straight salary for \u0022Superman\u0022 equals or exceeds the new record of\n$1 million a day Harrison Ford set\nwith\nK-19: The Widowmaker (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie\u0027s sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for\nSuperman (1978), Brando had picked up $2\nmillion for his extended cameo in\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u0027s\nApocalypse Now (1979) in a role,\nthat of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation\nwhile Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando\u0027s last bravura star\nperformance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in The Formula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination\nfor his supporting role in A Dry White Season (1989)\nafter coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those\nwho claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his\nentire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy The Freshman (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn\u0027t get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when\n\u0022Life\u0022 magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were\nboth then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and\nsnowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of\nThe Men (1950), Brando had gone to live\nat a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans,\nand confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting\nmethod, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before,\nand that willingness to experience life.",

When\nwork became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in\nminor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company\nof the hit 1950s musical \u0022Grease\u0022 brought him back to New York.

    "Info": "Benjamin G\u00E9za \u0022Ben\u0022 Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to mother Chris Anne (Boldt), a school teacher, and father Timothy Byers \u0022Tim\u0022 Affleck, a social worker. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, G\u00E9za, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben\u0027s teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Dazed and Confused (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith\u0027s Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben\u0027s career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn\u0027t last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn\u0027t willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben\u0027s breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Changing Lanes (2002), The Sum of All Fears (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Gigli (2003) and Surviving Christmas (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin\u0027 Aces (2006), He\u0027s Just Not That Into You (2009), State of Play (2009), and Extract (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck\u0027s second Oscar win).In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), and Justice League (2017). He reprised the role in Zack Snyder\u0027s Justice League (2021) and he will next appear as Batman in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) and The Flash (2023).Recently he has given praise-worthy performances in The Way Back (2020) as a recovering alcoholic, The Last Duel (2021) (notably he also co-wrote the script), and a scene-stealing golden globe nominated performance in The Tender Bar (2021).",

    "Info": "McAvoy was born on 21 April 1979 in Glasgow, Scotland, to James, a bus driver, and Elizabeth (n\u00E9e Johnstone), a nurse. He was raised on a housing estate in Drumchapel, Glasgow by his maternal grandparents (James, a butcher, and Mary), after his parents divorced when James was 11. He went to St Thomas Aquinas Secondary in Jordanhill, Glasgow, where he did well enough and started \u0027a little school band with a couple of mates\u0027.McAvoy toyed with the idea of the Catholic priesthood as a child but, when he was 16, a visit to the school by actor David Hayman sparked an interest in acting. Hayman offered him a part in his film The Near Room (1995) but despite enjoying the experience McAvoy didn\u0027t seriously consider acting as a career, although he did continue to act as a member of PACE Youth Theatre. He applied instead to the Royal Navy and had already been accepted when he was also offered a place at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD).He took the place at the RSAMD (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) and, when he graduated in 2000, he moved to London. He had already made a couple of TV appearances by this time and continued to get a steady stream of TV and movie work until he came to attention of the British public in 2004 playing car thief Steve McBride in the successful UK TV series Shameless (2004) and then to the rest of the world in 2005 as Mr Tumnus, the faun, in Disney\u0027s adaptation of C. S. Lewis\u0027s The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). In The Last King of Scotland (2006) McAvoy portrayed a Scottish doctor who becomes the personal physician to dictator Idi Amin, played by Forest Whitaker. McAvoy\u0027s career breakthrough came in Atonement (2007), Joe Wright\u0027s 2007 adaption of Ian McEwan\u0027s novel.Since then, McAvoy has taken on theatre roles, starring in Shakespeare\u0027s \u0027Macbeth\u0027 (directed by Jamie Lloyd), which launched the first Trafalgar Transformed season in London\u0027s West End and earned him an Olivier award nomination for Best Actor. In January 2015, McAvoy returned to the Trafalgar Studios stage to play Jack Gurney, the delusional 14th Earl of Gurney who believes he is Jesus, in the first revival of Peter Barnes\u0027s satire \u0027The Ruling Class\u0027, a role for which he was subsequently awarded the London Evening Standard Theatre Award\u0027s Best Actor.On screen, McAvoy has appeared as corrupt cop Bruce Robertson in Filth (2013), a part for which he received a Scottish BAFTA for Best Actor, a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor, a London Critics Circle Film Award for British Actor of the Year and an Empire Award for Best Actor. More recently, he reprised his role as Professor Charles Xavier in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and X-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019). He began his depiction of Kevin Wendell Crumb, also known as The Horde, a man with an extreme case of dissociative identity disorder in M. Night Shyamalan\u0027s thriller Split (2016) and continued it in the sequel, Glass (2019). Also in 2019, he played Bill Denbrough in It Chapter Two (2019), the horror sequel to It (2017).McAvoy and Jamie Lloyd look set to continue their collaboration in December 2019, with a production of \u0027Cyrano de Bergerac\u0027 at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End, London. The project has been on the cards as long ago as 2017, when McAvoy posted a picture of him reading the script and wearing a false nose.",
